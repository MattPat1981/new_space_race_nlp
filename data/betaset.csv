BlueOrigin,"You said technical interview, so I am assuming that this is the phone screen with the hiring manager and not the panel interview. 

Some advice is to know EVERYTHING that is on the job description and if you don't know, look it up. You don't have to be an expert on everything, but at least have a general idea of what everything is in case they ask, because you don't want to come off as clueless for something that is important to that job in particular.

When talking about the basics, it should be the basics in reference to the skills refered to in the job description, not necessarily the basics of your major, although quickly reviewing that would help. Just know that it's not reasonable to try to learn 4 years of content in a week, so mainly focus on what can be applicable to the job description.

Be prepared to talk about your projects/experience and talking about yourself in a brief and concise way. A lot of the times, the specific experience you got from an internship, project, etc. will be what landed you the interview in the first place, so be prepared to talk about that. 

You already should, but know everything on your resume inside and out. You will likely be asked some things about your resume.

Prepare some questions to ask about the job, whether it be the day to day work, the company culture, the team you would be on, or something a little technical.

I'm not an EE and don't know much about this position in particular, so I can't help you out much when it comes to specifics, but this is what I did in my experience that helped me build the confidence for my interviews. 

What they are looking for is someone with a strong base knowledge, a passion for their work, and a good team member that they can relate to. Don't be a know it all, be humble, be confident, and most importantly be honest. 

I hope this helped. Best of luck.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hu1qh8/upcoming_technical_interview_need_advice/fyl60os/

&gt;engineering fundamentals

There's nothing really you can cram for in terms of engineering fundamentals that will affect the outcome of the interview. It's one of those ""either you have it or you don't"". 

Instead of cramming, I'd spend the time of coming up with a good answer for why you want to work for Blue Origin though.

BlueOrigin,"I'm a firm believer that there is nothing your going to brush up on that's going to radically change an interview. Your interview team will likely ask you something they expect you to have been exposed to in school, but they will likely probe at the depth of your self-declared skills (i.e. from your resume) to gauge your technical background.

Anything that isn't on your resume they'll be softer on. They may ask if you have exposure to a topic or tool with the full knowledge that you'll need guidance or time to learn new skills.

Try not to stress, read through your resume again, and know that they want to find your skill set. The goal of an interview team is not to blow you away nor to be blown away.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hu1qh8/upcoming_technical_interview_need_advice/fykrkud/

The cultural impact on a company that is already very, very gradatim in their approach (possibly due to the lack of a need to turn a profit to survive) could also be somewhat fatal to recovering from such a disaster.

BlueOrigin,"&gt; What testing has been done on New Glenn? Have an all engine test been done yet?

Given that New Glenn uses the BE-4 for its first stage, and they just sent a pathfinder BE-4 over to ULA, the answer to that seems to be pretty likely no. Taken together with the fact that an all engine test of a rocket that size would be tough to conceal, so even with Blue's secrecy we'd likely have some indication, it seems like the answer to this is no. 

That said, this doesn't mean that the idea suggested by the OP isn't a bad one. New Glenn is a much more useful rocket, and it isn't clear that New Shepard has much of a substantial market.

The press releases are talking about a system of 3 components... and will launch on New Glenn **AND** Vulcan.

That doesn't mean all 3 components **COULD** launch on Vulcan or New Glenn. 

Does it say that? Does it say all three components are launch vehicle agnostic and could launch on any vehicle? No. No it does not. It doesn't say anything **SPECIFIC** except that the National Team is choosing Vulcan and New Glenn. It doesn't specifically say any elements can **ONLY** launch on one vehicle.

The language used isn't specific as to how those individual elements need to be delivered.... so its completely open to interpretation *one way or the other* as to how those launches are distributed.

If you can find a recent source that says **THE BLUE MOON DESCENT VEHICLE** is able to launch on New Glenn OR Vulcan than awesome - we have an answer. **Anything else** just means that at least 1 of 3 elements of the National Team Human Landing **SYSTEM** will launch on Vulcan.

BlueOrigin,"Starship competes with F9 / FH. Once Starship starts making orbit, SpaceX will switch Starlink to it immediately. So it will quickly be launching once a month or more. It doesn't even need 100% reuse; it'll still be saving money over the equivalent F9 launches. 

This could happen sooner than you think. Once Starship is hopping, the common elements it shares with SuperHeavy are done, and there is no reason to defer SuperHeavy any more. They will develop them both in parallel: stacking SuperHeavy, working on the thrust dome, and getting it to land; and developing Starship's control surfaces, heat shield, and getting it to land. All the signs point to this phase starting within a month or two. That's why they're preparing the SuperHeavy high bay. It's still possible they'll be able to stack them both and attempt orbit by the end of the year. If not, then early next year. 

So if New Glenn is not flying until 2022, it'll be competing with an F9 / FH that is already obsolete. F9 will still be wanted by customers for its track record. New Glenn won't have that track record. It'll get some payloads, but only because the industry wants multiple launch providers.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hqktee/sadly_none_of_the_big_rockets_we_hoped_to_see_fly/fxysql8/

BlueOrigin,"There are multiple races in place, not a singular race.

New Glenn and Starship are competing directly on their HLS proposals of which launch vehicles are key.

New Glenn , F9/FH, Omega and Vulcan are all competing directly on the NSSL competition of which the deadline is imminent.

There's a bunch of new GEO satellites being ordered right now that should have launch contracts issued soon due to 5G spectrum clearing.

Any upcoming launch for NASA such as the Gateway PPE/Habitat can only launch on certified vehicles, of which only FH seems to be ready for.

I like the ""rising tides lift all ships"" mentality as much as the next guy - but there very much ARE races within the launch marketplace. The longer it takes any rocket to get its first flight off the ground the longer it will take to achieve varying certifications or build customer contracts. All those delays result in missed revenue opportunities that will hinder the growth of Blue Origin or any other company. 

Unless Elon Musk or a SpaceX source has revealed some information to you that contradicts publicly available information on Starship the plan is to have Starship launch basically all payloads that F9/FH fly now - that's directly competing New Glenn and Starship. And of course *IF* they realize their goals of full inexpensive reuse, then New Glenn's competing against an obsolete line of vehicles in F9/FH. Surely the company would be in a better place if they could close off development of their current vehicle and work on improvements ASAP.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hqktee/sadly_none_of_the_big_rockets_we_hoped_to_see_fly/fxyr4mn/

It's like you're putting people who have ideas you disagree with into a box and labeling it for easy consumption/dismissal instead of listening to everyone as an individual.

&gt; What a vapid, un-American take on things.

To me his views sound like a lot of the letters written about the constitutional convention on *both* the Federalist and anti-Federalist side. Also a lot of Americans now probably agree with him. I fail to see what you mean by ""un-American"".

&gt; How is a state making a law or regulation any different than the federal government doing the same?

Federalism. Local representation. Culture. Why not a one-world government?

&gt; Do you denounce states for regulating things? Do you denounce all regulations? Or are you just a hypocritical, half-assed anarchist?

He views sound consistently Federalist to me. (which is a large tent - both the Republican and Democratic parties ostensibly support Federalist policies)

&gt; What is the difference between being represented by my city, my state or my country? I see none.

Federalism. Local representation. Culture. In a democratic state, it's the difference in being 1/10,000th of the legal quorum vs being 1/1,000,000th or 1/300,000,000th. Ability to enact change where it's easiest, and limit the damage done by things that are harder to change. Cultural differences will become less important as the Internet homogenizes culture, but there will always be the case of the larger state caring less and paying attention less to local concerns than to national concerns. It's not that large-scale government shouldn't exist, but the laws that I had little representation in creating (naturally) should have proportionally little effect on my life. This doesn't prevent local communities from creating problems, but limits potential problems the larger community might inflict on all its constituent parts that have wildly different views on things.

&gt; Why would I fear a law governing my country when I do not fear a law governing my state or my city? Why fear being a part of a country when you do not fear being a part of a state or city?

Level of power and the exclusive right of physical force. An un-policed local government can be terribly unjust, but a national government is much harder to police in the first place.

He didn't say anything like that. I have no contempt for French people but I wouldn't want anyone in France having a say in how I live. I don't see how it's any different at a national level. Our national culture is much more homogeneous, but not as much as you think.

I'd like to think they are an inalienable truth of human experience, but as long as we have a state in the job of protecting the ""rights"" of some against the ""rights"" of others, what a ""right"" is will be an inherently political issue.

Then can shift up to higher tiers for things that have large scale and universal impact, like Internet regulation, but generally having rules imposed on your community when your community had very little say in the matter causes discontent and conflict. *Sometimes* this is worth it, but often times it's a mistake we don't rectify for generations. Having multiple polities with their own ideas of ""rights and liberties"" is the only way to guarantee ""rights and liberties"" for all, at the potential expense of minority groups who disagree with the majority. If they cannot convince others in their community to agree, moving across state lines is exactly what they should have to do to protect their rights and way of life. (assuming they have the freedom to do so, which admittedly isn't always true) It means we can experiment at a local level to find the ""best"" forms of government over time, and like minded people can live together while coexisting peacefully with their neighbors across the border who might disagree on a few things. If something is truly better, it will eventually spread to most places through cultural shift. IMO any larger political entity should mainly be concerned with protecting that way of life, promoting freedom of speech and trade (because it allows for necessary cultural and economic changes), and advocating for people that have terrible injustices committed against them and have nowhere to go. It might be naive but I think this idea combined with pacifism universally applied would end conflict and war, in my opinion. 

My political bias partly comes from a belief that an ideal form of government would be one that can be equally applied to all humankind, not just the United States, so your *""We are ONE country, united and indivisible""* is kind of a meaningless distinction to me. Having multiple states (nations) around the planet with various cultures seems to be fine with people, but somehow they think they should have a say of what happens on the other side of the continent because of legal precedent. An appeal to authority vs. logic.

That's just like my opinion which is probably full of inconsistencies and I don't mind if people disagree. :) But I'm afraid if you had your way you'd like to force the entire world to accept your beliefs and your idea of what ""rights and liberties"" should be taken away from some in the name of giving them to others. Bringing ""civilization"" to the ""barbarians"", and uniting the tribe/islands/peninsula/continent in the name of peace has been a motivating factor for the use of force for as long as government has existed, and will continue to be so as long as those who don't really believe in individual freedom are in charge.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hoxktt/ajit_pai_on_twitter_suggesting_kuiper_will_be/fxsrvvn/

BlueOrigin,"This is a good summary.

Realize that the company had fewer than 1,000 employees until 2018 and is now almost at 3,000, so even if nobody had left since then the majority of employees today would have been at Blue for fewer than 3 years.

That being said, the last few years have seen the departure of a lot of ""Old Blue"" employees. I think this has largely been the result of the company rapidly trying to transition from a small R&amp;D group to a medium-sized aerospace manufacturer. It's a fundamentally different company now than it was even in 2016, and it needs to be in order to execute on BE-4, New Glenn, and HLS. The changes, both good and bad, have driven a lot of people away who originally signed up for small R&amp;D Blue. A lot of these people have gone on to the new wave of space start ups.

I also know a number of people who left because they just burnt out. Some people definitely work ""SpaceX hours"" even if it's not company culture, and the acceleration from R&amp;D to production is particularly stressful for the people tasked with figuring out how to do this. In many cases, these people end up fighting against ""Old Blue"" company culture that still wants to pretend it's a small, lean R&amp;D startup.

I'm personally optimistic about Blue's future because I've seen the company steadily improving for several years now, and the programs and technologies we're working on (both public and not public) are incredibly exciting.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hog4uw/employees_leaving/fxrtpd3/

I'd just like to point out that they weren't saying you don't support gay marriage, but that thinking a public good can be just left to some states to acknowledge while others deprive people of a certain right (in this case, the protection of Net Neutrality) is naive. It was an analogy.

Corporations operate across state lines and often are global. Letting them bring their collective resources to bear in lobbying (which often amounts to legal bribery) from state to state on a public utility as important as the Internet, gives them an advantage over the states and a massive advantage over customers.

https://www.freepress.net/our-response/expert-analysis/explainers/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history

&gt; MADISON RIVER:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.
&gt; 
&gt; COMCAST: In 2007, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.
&gt; 
&gt; TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.
&gt; 
&gt; AT&amp;T: From 2007–2009, AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene in 2009.
&gt; 
&gt; WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.
&gt; 
&gt; MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.
&gt; 
&gt; PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. 
&gt; 
&gt; AT&amp;T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.
&gt; 
&gt; EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. 
&gt; 
&gt; VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.
&gt; 
&gt; AT&amp;T: In 2012, AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T’s own products.
&gt; 
&gt; NETWORK-WIDE: Throughout 2013 and early 2014, people across the country experienced slower speeds when trying to connect to certain kinds of websites and applications. Many complained about underperforming streaming video from sites like Netflix. Others had trouble connecting to video-conference sites and making voice calls over the internet.
&gt; 
&gt; The common denominator for all of these problems, unbeknownst to users at the time, was their ISPs’ failure to provide enough capacity for this traffic to make it on to their networks in the first place. In other words, the problem was not congestion on the broadband lines coming into homes and businesses, but at the “interconnection” point where the traffic users’ request from other parts of the internet first comes into the ISPs’ networks.
&gt; 
&gt; An Open Technology Institute investigation that drew on the Measurement Lab’s data analysis found these slowdowns were the result of “intentional policies by some of the nation’s largest communications companies, which led to significant, months-long degradation of a consumer product for millions of people.” Major broadband providers, including AT&amp;T, Time Warner Cable and Verizon, deliberately limited the capacity at these interconnection points, effectively throttling the delivery of content to thousands of U.S. businesses and residential customers across the country.
&gt; 
&gt; VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hoxktt/ajit_pai_on_twitter_suggesting_kuiper_will_be/fxp3mol/

I agree with your concern of corruption in the federal government which is why I disagree with handing over more power to them.

Furthermore, Net Neutrality is obviously necessary as demonstrated by those states enacting net neutrality laws to ensure it remains in effect. That the FCC refuses to continue to recognize net neutrality at the federal level because Ajit Pai is a corrupt piece of shit doesn't mean it isn't necessary. Do you even know how bad that take is?

Furthermore, the matter isn't even resolved yet. Just because they repealed it doesn't mean they're free and clear to do whatever the hell they want. States have taken the initiative to enact their own net neutrality legislation or at least propose it while also challenging the FCC's adherence to legal process in the appeal.

BlueOrigin,"There is some accurate and lots of inaccurate or rumors in this thread. I'll try my best to not be biased.

Many groups are &lt;2 years old, as there has been a massive hiring boom over the past couple of years. If you are at Blue for longer than 2 years, you're basically a senior based on the percentages. The company essentially doubled in staff within the past couple of years, with the outlook looking about the same grown rate for at least the next couple of years. In two years from now, you'll be seen as the elder.

Regarding overtime, there is no forced overtime unless you are on the team doing something hot (think like a massive test that everyone is depending on). Even after then, there is enough work-life balance that managers will tell that group to go easy for a while after the job is done. Yes people work overtime, but it is usually out of their own passion and ambition rather than a manager edict. I'm sure there are outliers that I'm not aware of though.


Below is one possible explanation for the exodus from what I've heard: 

Think of the company's past as a small company in the wild west. You can do A, B, and C, then go down to the shops and make a D and E by yourself. If you needed an F, go to the hardware store, buy something similar, and maybe mod it to make an F yourself. You can order G and H from any supplier that makes them as long as you can get it today or tomorrow.

Blue has grown so much that it is more difficult for an engineer to do A, B, and C all at once, and so Blue hires folks who can do A, B, and C better, faster, and more efficiently independently. Fewer ""Jack-of-all-trades, master of none"" and more specialization.

Now Blue is getting to the part about certification and flight-worthiness. You no longer want just anyone to make stuff on their own, you probably want people who are trained specifically to make D's and E's. You don't want to mod stuff on the fly to make an F, as you should probably properly design and procure it. You only want to order G's and H's from reputable suppliers who have necessary certifications and can guarantee their products.

The folks who enjoy the wild west leave Blue because this old culture has changed. There is more paperwork now due to the newer processes, and paperwork slows people down. The paperwork is needed to make sure things are properly tracked and can be traced to relevant purchase orders and approved engineering changes.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hog4uw/employees_leaving/fxk623u/

3. I in some ways agree that unions for engineers isn’t good when you look at things like Boeing. I understand that unions can sometimes stand in the way of top-tier efficiency which is necessary in a low-profit-margin industry like commercial spaceflight (Boeing is govt spaceflight for the most part). But overall when a CEO absolutely demonizes unions like Musk and Bezos, it is just a clear statement that they want to wring out their employees in a bad way.

BlueOrigin,"Realize that the company had fewer than 1,000 employees until 2018, so even if nobody had left since then the majority of employees today would have been at Blue for fewer than 3 years.

That being said, the last few years have seen the departure of a lot of ""Old Blue"" employees, including the founding President, Rob Meyerson. I think this has largely been the result of the company rapidly trying to transition from a tiny R&amp;D company to a medium-sized aerospace manufacturer. It's a fundamentally different company now than it was even in 2016, and it needs to be in order to execute on BE-4, New Glenn, and HLS. The changes, both good and bad, have driven a lot of people away who originally signed up for small R&amp;D Blue. A lot of these people have gone on to the new wave of space start ups.

I also know a number of people who left because they just burnt out. Some people definitely work ""SpaceX hours"" even if it's not company culture, and the acceleration from R&amp;D to production is particularly stressful for the people tasked with figuring out how to do this. In many cases, these people end up fighting against ""Old Blue"" company culture that still wants to pretend it's a small, lean R&amp;D startup.

I'm personally optimistic about Blue's future because I've seen the company steadily improving for several years now, the programs and technologies we're working on (both public and not public) are incredibly exciting, and the people I work with by and large are incredibly competent.

2. Have you ever heard what it’s like to work for SpaceX? Where they demand 100 hour workweeks on a salary deserving of a 40 hour week? Blue Origin’s only marginally better.


3. The reason for that is in engineering, it takes one hyperactive person less effort total to do a task working 100 hours a week than it would take to have three engineers do it together and have to communicate and explain what’s going on. But it’s massively unhealthy to work people like that. And unions don’t let that happen. That’s why Musk and Bezos are anti-union *rainbow emoji*


None of it is sustainable. SpaceX and Blue Origin churn through young engineers like candy. The 5% that don’t burn out are Elon Musk-esquire and end up very high in the companies. But, they inspire enough talent that it hasn’t failed yet...

With NASA signing the agreement and New Shepard actually being a currently existing flight-worthy system I think it has to come first unless Blue simply drops the whole system. 

Vulcan before New Glenn for two reasons. First, Blue appears to have made ULA a priority; and second, as BE-4 seems to be the delaying factor the five extra engines for NG are going to add to any delay. 

Plus, there’s also the BE-3U, which is still in testing. It’s not just a BE-3 with a bigger nozzle like Merlin vs Merlin Vacuum. Blue is also shifting from a combustion tap-off to an expander cycle.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hmv0q8/what_will_happen_first_ns_takes_people_to_space/fxcdd4h/

To prove your point that they announce timetables, you cite a May 2020 announcement of an upcoming event that also happened in... May 2020. You will have to forgive me for not considering that a meaningful industry timetable.

Similarly with the other point - they didn't announce a target date for BE-4 delivery until late [February 2020] 
(https://www.geekwire.com/2020/blue-origin-lays-ambitious-plan-rocket-engine-production-opens-alabama-factory/) - 18 months after they got the contract, when it was less than 3 months away. Again, that's not a timetable, it's an announcement that they've almost finished something. (3 months then turned into 5 months, a ~70% time overrun, which is admittedly typical compared to SpaceX/SLS, but that is not directly relevant here.)

The point is, BO doesn't release public timelines like other aerospace companies do, they keep their cards close to their chest until they've nearly completed something. That's completely fine, and I have nothing bad to say about that, even though as a fan I would selfishly like to know more about what they're working on and the progress they're making.

Once they unveil their orbital crew vehicle (which will have an actual market to service, and likely will cost about as much per flight, and is actually on the critical path for their long term plans), they'll slip in a note about how NS is being retired to focus on bigger and better things.

BlueOrigin,"Vulcan was supposed to have already flown. It has not flown yet, ergo there has been a delay. Theres been no indication of delays in the rest of the Vulcan program (intentional schedule shifts enabled by more generous customer requirements, which allowed the initial version to be much more powerful and much cheaper than initially planned, don't count), and indeed ULAs approach to the rest of Vulcans systems is inherently delay-tolerant (most systems could be substituted for their predecessor designs if needed, the opposite of what is being done on Atlas. Drop-in replacements go both ways typically). Meanwhile Blue has failed to meet even that adjusted schedule, despite (as far as we know) no noteworthy improvements to the engines performance or cost to justify the delay",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hmv0q8/what_will_happen_first_ns_takes_people_to_space/fx98jtl/

When something is that imminent, it's not an example of sticking to a far reaching programmatic schedule.

Similarly, the BE-4 is hardly a well-documented schedule success. What's your source on a May delivery estimate, and when was that stated? ULA's Vulcan has slipped a full year for its first launch, driven principally by delays in actually getting the BE-4 engines (eg., see this [article](https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-delivers-the-first-be-4-engine-to-united-launch-alliance/). This first engine is also a pathfinder engine, not a flight engine. We still have no idea when the first flight engine is scheduled to be delivered.

None of this is to say that BO is moving slower than expected, or that they're not making progress overcoming serious challenges.

I can't figure out why there are delays in flying people on NS; the technical challenges just aren't that great and the regulations for flying people on that sort of flight are quite straightforward. 

In October 2016 they said they would fly passengers by EOY 2017, and here we are coming up on 3 years past that original time, for a 300% slip.

My conclusion is that putting people on New Shepherd has been at the bottom of the priority list for quite some time. I don't understand why they bother continuing that part of the program; with the estimated prices it won't be making them much money, the PR downside if somebody is hurt/killed is significant, and they're clearly very interested in both NG and Artemis right now.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hmv0q8/what_will_happen_first_ns_takes_people_to_space/fx7tp73/

Does it even have a boostback burn? I don't remember now.

Also you could argue that if a vehicle will never ever be used in an expendable configuration due to impossible economics (inability to make a profit in expendable operations) does it really count?

So Elon decided to make the engine version simpler, more srable at higher thrust and simpler by not having it throttle. The engine is meant to used on the booster which has 30+ engines and can effectively throttle by shuttle off engines.

BlueOrigin,"- Blue Origin knew it was taking on a big job, but restoring Test Stand 4670 turned out even bigger than the company thought

- “As we performed mitigation and sandblasting work, we discovered significant corrosion in the primary structure including rust that penetrated through 3-inch steel plates” lead engineer Scott Henderson said. Corrosion was expected - the stand has been out in the weather since the 1960

- Bezos himself has been monitoring the test stand’s development, and the Huntsville team said he was disappointed at the delay but understands the business. In many ways, rockets and space are his real passion

- “There are several advantages to having the test stand in Huntsville. “Propellants are easier to procure and less expensive than our Texas test site and the transportation and logistics are much more streamlined from factory to test to end customer. It’s economically the right way to go in the long haul.”

- The plant has 100 employees heading for roughly 450 next year operating in three shifts, five days a week, Pacheco said

- Blue Origin will use the stand to perform “acceptance tests” on each of the BE-3u and BE-4 engines it will build at a new rocket engine plant also in Huntsville

- An acceptance test fires each production engine for roughly 300 seconds or about 5 minutes. It proves the engine can reach and maintain the thrust it was designed for and is structurally sound. Each engine must be acceptance-tested

- A tour of the Blue Origin engine factory showed the steady emergence of a sophisticated system of parts supply “trains” that will serve massive lathes, milling machines and other tools that build rocket engines.

- Some of the machines are already assembled, and others will be soon.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hkjbwi/blue_origins_big_job_restoring_an_apollo_test/fwszyb0/

That doesn't make sense if FH is able to be the reserve launcher.  If the module is getting sized to fit into the Falcon fairing then it's not making use of New Glenn's larger fairing.

The only way I see this is true is if there are some optional add ons/changes they can leave off for the FH configuration, but I doubt it.

IDSSs hatch has not been a limiting factor for ISS planning. NASA would like to discontinue use of CBM entirely, it adds a lot of crew labor and there are no planned payloads which require that width. Easier to just design equipment to be modular if the combined unit is too large to fit through, and in most cases the bulk of that payload us really just structure which doesn't need to be sent up and down",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hk72xe/interview_with_the_module_manufacturer_of_the/fwrhqdk/

I think Axiom mentioned somewhere that every module would be able to autonomously dock, such that they will be able to assemble on orbit without needing robotic berthing. From your summary, it sounds like they are going to use the International Docking System Standard (IDSS) throughout. They can mate to IDA-2 on Node 2 and build out the back of the ISS, always providing an additional port for visiting vehicles.

The size of IDSS is a bit of a limitation for bringing up equipment, but the benefits of docking probably far outweigh that. It just seems a bit odd that the new cupola will be 'docked' but presumably it will be passive and have no hatch.

BlueOrigin,"Interview by ASI (Italian Space Agency) to the head of Thales Alenia Space Italia of ""Human Spacefight &amp; Transportation Programs"" and to the ASI chief of ""Human and Microgravity Flight"" focuses on the construction contract in Turin for 2 Axiom modules.

Some interesting news:

- Thales has signed the supply of the first two modules of the Axiom station with dimensions 4.4 in diameter and 9 meters in length (10.5 meters with the hook system). 2 meters longer than the current ISS modules (many always built in Turin by Alenia). The delivery of the first module to Axiom is scheduled for July 2023 and launch in September 2024. The launch of the second (residential) module is expected approximately 7 months later. All housing modules (even those not contracted) will have a window facing the ground

- to reduce costs compared to ISS modules, the way of hooking the ""cylinder"" at the two ends is changed and the cylinder will be built in two 4.5-meter halves that will be joined only in an advanced production phase

- The first launch will bring to Node 2 (made by Alenia) the first module consisting of a housing part, a node part and the super dome

- the super dome, like the ISS dome, will fly hooked to the node so as to form a line and subsequently from the robotic arm it will be moved so as to face the earth. Thales will present an offer in August of this year and thinks he has a good chance of making a part of it

- the launcher identified is the New Glenn and as a reserve the Falcon Heavy

At the end of the video are listed some things that will be done by Thales Alenia Space for the Moon and Mars:

- part of the Orion service module

- part of the Halo module (the initial housing part of the Gateway)

- prime contractor of the I-Hab (the large housing module of the Gateway, Euro-Japanese contribution)

- part of the Esprit module (European refueling and communication module of the Gateway)

- the cabin of the Dynetics Human Landing System (the only non-American company that participates in the development of a lunar lander)

BlueOrigin,"I agree, but ULA are in an awkward spot. For starters I don’t see them being able to perform propulsive landings with the BE-4 as the thrust-to-weight of the empty booster is too high. They’d need to develop a new rocket.

I think the main reason they’re sticking with SMART is because ULA doesn’t get the development investment they need from their parent companies to develop something like reuse. SpaceX invested $1 billion into reusability and it took dozens of launches to get right. 

ULA gets a lot of their contracts from the government so price isn’t their primary concern. If ULA win a portion of the NSSL launches and snag up some NASA missions like they have been doing with Dreamchaser think they’ll be in a good spot in the market for the next half decade.

BlueOrigin,"This also connects with getting high quality employees. I've taught a lot of engineering undergrads who wanted to go to work in space related matters. A lot of them specifically want to work for SpaceX, and smaller numbers wanting to work specifically for Boeing or Rocketlab. I've basically never had a student who had a specific goal of working for Blue Origin. Blue just isn't getting young engineers excited the same way SpaceX or Rocketlab is. That likely means that SpaceX can get a larger group of potential employees to pick from, get higher quality people, and potentially pay them less.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hj3g2b/jeff_bezos_should_expand_his_promotion_of_space/fwli8nz/

BlueOrigin,"Honestly, if he wants to get people more excited, the solution is ""do things,"" or if they're not moving fast enough to consistently be doing things, ""be more public about the progress you *are* making, and how that puts you on track to eventually do things."" Take the BE-4 engine, for example. How many full-size, full-pressure engines have they built? How many have been tested, and with what duration and chamber pressure? Are there neat videos of these tests? How close are they to shipping Vulcan's first pair, and how long will it take to ramp up production to get the New Glenn running?

When I first read that Blue Origin was pushing heavily into engine development, and competing against Aerojet to build the engine for Vulcan, I got excited, and thought I finally understood the company. But in the years since, from the outside it looks like they've done nothing, certainly no advancements with regards to New Shepard, and very little progress on anything else (other than building some factories, which could be empty for all we know). They have put out the occasional promotional video with people talking about the exciting work they're doing, but I don't want to see taking heads; I want to see rockets.

In short, if you want to excite people, be exciting. At this point I'm almost more excited about Astra Space than about Blue Origin, and up until the start of this year Astra Space was better known as ""stealth-mode space launch company,"" because they had zero publicity and even got their name scrubbed from contracts like the DARPA Launch Challenge. I guess their sudden turnaround shows that such change is possible, but it's yet to be seen if Blue Origin will do so.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hj3g2b/jeff_bezos_should_expand_his_promotion_of_space/fwldjew/

BlueOrigin,"Want to grow interest? Blue Origin needs to stop being so secretive.  Talk about details of their plans and hardware not just flashing the odd image and corporate press release. Engage with the community and answer questions.

Within commercial space there are a lot of  companies that hold things close to their chest but Blue Origin is by FAR the worst. I could list a huge string of space companies that do better PR than Blue, it's huge because it is pretty well everyone.

Take Blue Moon. Nobody can give a straight answer to how big the thing is yet it is the most exciting near term project of theirs? How about flying crew to orbit?  Tapping lunar resources? How or when does any of that happen?  Noone outside Blue knows because they can't offer even hints of how they would enable these things.

Blue Origin's stated purpose is to have ""millions of people living and working in space"" and yet their public facing actions are of a company hiding in the shadows. 

How can I or anyone get excited about a company that says they will enable this incredible future ""for humanity "" (their words) when the company doesn't actually openly engage with humanity?

SpaceX has done more for interest in space exploration that decades of NASA outreach simply because they do cool things and they get lots of video.

sure, BO does not have an orbital rocket yet, but there are things they could do:

1. keep us in the loop with development. adults and kids like to learn about specs and designs

BlueOrigin,"Like others have said, it's a little late,  but not impossible, for a new grad to get in the game.

My biggest recommendation to get noticed is to only apply to a few jobs that you are most interested in and have good experience that you can talk about extensively. Don't just apply to any entry level position you see. Recruiters don't like to see when you've applied to 40 positions that are completely unrelated to each other. 

Alway be on the lookout for job postings. I used Linkedin to keep up with their job postings but I am sure there are other ways. Applying as early as possible always help. 

When you find the few jobs you are most interested in, CATER YOUR RESUME TO THE SPECIFIC POSITION. If you have an objective/summary statement in your resume, write that you want to be a ___ engineer because of ___ knowledge and experience. Put some of the keywords for that position into your resume under skills or projects/experience. Highlight your experience that is most relevant to that specific position.

After applying, it wouldn't hurt to reach out to a recruiter or someone on Linkedin. But make sure you can definitely say why you want that position, why you're interested in Blue Origin, and why you are qualified for that position.

Basically everything is about just getting through to a recruiter who will then pass you on to the hiring manager. If you really know your stuff, can talk about it passionately, answer questions about it, and prove that you would be a useful asset to that team, then I'd say you have a good shot at getting hired. But it all starts out with getting your resume noticed. 

If you are unfamiliar, the hiring process is first a phone call with a recruiter, followed by a phone call with the hiring manager. If those go well, then you move onto the final stage which consists of 1. Writing an essay/summary for a given topic related to spaceflight and 2. An in person (now, virtual) one hour long presentation followed by one-on-one interviews that are primarily focused on technical questions related to the position. This is around a 4 hour process.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hhrt6d/best_way_to_get_into_bo/fwfr9ys/

BlueOrigin,"Yup! I thought about that, but I didn't bring it up because it only applies to SpaceX, not necessarily to other companies developing reusability. If the only argument in favor of the commercial viability of reusability ends up being ""I guess you could build and launch your own satellite network pretty cheaply?"" then other companies are entirely correct to be avoiding the expense of development.

In SpaceX's case though, Starlink definitely makes first stage (and faring) reusability worth it. 

I seem to remember Shotwell mentioning that three Block 4 boosters cost them half as much to reuse as a new booster. Even assuming that block 5 didn't get any better, that means that block 4 boosters cost ~15 million less per internal launch than an expendable booster. The entire reusability program is probably nearing 1.5 billion dollars now (it was said to be 1 billion already by 2016 IIRC), so that means by the time we hit 100-ish Starlink launches the program will have paid for itself just from Starlink savings alone. Roughly. 

Given that we should be seeing 25 to 30 Starlink missions each year for the next couple of years until Starship is up and running enough to take over internal cargo launches, that means we should end up seeing almost enough Starlink launches of F9 to justify the program expenses all by itself. And this isn't even including the rolled over benefits to Superheavy (which will use exactly the same landing technique) or the unknowable additional profit from F9/FH commercial and government launches.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hgb9fw/jeff_bezos_blue_origin_thinks_it_can_beat_spacex/fw5vg3m/
BlueOrigin,"""Yes, SpaceX had to launch a rocket successfully before NASA gave them any money.""

I believe you might be incorrect:

Falcon 1 flight 4 was their first successful orbital flight in September 2008.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_1#Fourth_flight

SpaceX was a successful bidder for the first round of COTS in May 2006. They received $278 million to help develop the Falcon 9 - although some (all?) of that was gated on milestones.

""On 18 August 2006, NASA announced that SpaceX had won a NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to the International Space Station with a possible option for crew transport.[6] This contract, designed by NASA to provide ""seed money"" for development of new boosters, paid SpaceX $278 million to develop the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, with incentive payments paid at milestones culminating in three demonstration launches.""

BlueOrigin,"Three companies are vying to land NASA astronauts on the moon for the first time in half a century, and one — Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos — is banking on extreme teamwork to win the day.

NASA is making an aggressive push to return humans to the moon in 2024 with a program called Artemis. If the US space agency succeeds, it'd be the first crewed lunar landing since Apollo astronauts last hopped across its dusty cratered surface in December 1972.

This time, however, NASA is racing to go back with less lead time and funding by farming out the design, testing, and operation of a landing system through a multibillion-dollar competition.

NASA picked its three favorite commercial concepts this spring and on April 30 announced Blue Origin, SpaceX (founded by Elon Musk), and Dynetics as its three options for landing on the moon.

Blue Origin won a $579 million contract, Dynetics got one worth $253 million, and SpaceX earned $135 million from NASA to develop their ideas into real-life hardware, software, and data so the agency could make an informed decision about its final pick. The winning team could get access to about $20 billion in contracts for a completed landing system and mission.

￼ 

An artist's concept of SpaceX's Starship spaceship on the surface of the moon. SpaceX SpaceX and Dynetics are each going it mostly alone to develop spaceships that can land cargo and crew on the moon's surface.

SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Blue Origin, however, recruited aerospace titans Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Draper Laboratory — all of which played key roles in the Apollo missions of the 1960s and '70s. The alliance, which has been working together for more than a year, named itself the ""National Team"" because the companies' joint effort to reach the moon is spread across 16 states.

During a video call with reporters on Thursday, John Couluris, the manager of Blue Origin's moon program (and a previous SpaceX employee), made it clear he believed National Team would win NASA's historic competition.

""We need each other, we work together, and we have an integrated solution,"" Couluris said. ""We're here to stay, and we are going to be the team that gets the country and the world to the moon in 2024.""

Sprinting back to the lunar surface

￼

NASA is already working on a rocket and spaceship to fly its astronauts to the moon.

The spaceship, Orion, is a carryover from a prior (and now defunct) space program and has been in development for nearly 15 years. NASA is also managing the building of a 32-story one-use rocket called Space Launch System (SLS), which was announced in 2011 to replace the then retiring space shuttle. Orion is designed to ride atop an SLS rocket out to the vicinity of the moon.

Both systems are years behind schedule and billions over budget. NASA expects to launch an uncrewed Artemis 1 test mission around the moon (but not land on it) in November 2021. If all goes well, a crewed Artemis 2 test flight on a similar mission is supposed to follow a year later.

By the end of 2024, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has said the US space agency intends to launch a crewed Artemis 3 mission and land ""the first woman and the next man"" on the moon.

￼ 

An artist's concept of NASA astronauts returning to the surface of the moon via its Artemis program. NASA 

Later in the decade, NASA hopes to build a permanent base on the lunar surface for astronaut crews to cycle through. Mission planners are eyeing the moon's south pole, where permanently shadowed floors of impact craters may hide billions of tons of frozen water — an off-world resource that could be melted, split into hydrogen and oxygen, stored, and later used to rocket the first people to Mars.

NASA also envisions frequent lunar landings with the help of a moon-orbiting Lunar Gateway space station, where crews could stay between bouts on the surface, though the projected expense of that project (and Artemis generally) has met resistance in Congress.

Meanwhile, NASA is running out of time to meet its goal of 2024, which is the last year President Donald Trump would be in office if he was reelected in November.

Orion is not equipped to land on the moon, though, which is where Dynetics, SpaceX, and Blue Origin's National Team are poised to help NASA.

Dividing and conquering to return to the moon

National Team pitched NASA a human-landing system, or HLS, with three main parts: a transfer element by Northrop Grumman, a descent element by Blue Origin, and an ascent element led by Lockheed Martin. For each element, Draper is developing autonomous systems that could not only self-assemble the elements in space but also land on any spot on the moon, Couluris said.

The transfer vehicle is a system that can dock with either Orion or Gateway (if the space station is ready in time) and propel the other two elements into position to land. In the future, it could also serve as a depot to refuel elements for future missions.

The descent element is a lunar lander called Blue Moon, and it's a platform designed to rocket the mission to a soft touchdown on the surface.

￼ 

An illustration of lunar-landing hardware for NASA's Artemis program. Blue Origin/National Team 

Lockheed's ascent element is a small spaceship that'd ride on top of Blue Moon and house the astronauts during a surface mission. When the mission is over, the ascent element would launch off Blue Moon, reconnect with the transfer element, and either fly the crew back to the Gateway or directly to a waiting Orion spaceship.

""Each of the three HLS elements has the ability to be launched separately, or on a combination of either commercial launch vehicles and/or the Space Launch System,"" Paul Anderson, an engineer and director at Lockheed who's working on the National Team, said during Thursday's call. ""Independent of that, the Orion spacecraft will house the crew and fly the crew during launch. And then, of course, return them safely to Earth.""

Such flexibility may prove vital, since delays with SLS could continue amid the coronavirus pandemic: Having the ability to launch elements separately, perhaps on Blue Origin's forthcoming New Glenn rocket, then assemble them in space, could buy precious time to meet the 2024 mandate.

National Team is planning some on-orbit demonstrations of prototypes, including docking. If the group survives NASA's next round of selection, however, Couluris said the group would launch and set down an uncrewed Blue Moon lander on the lunar surface in 2023.

￼ 

An illustration of lunar-landing hardware for NASA's Artemis program. Blue Origin/National Team ""Immediately, we have the experience of landing on the moon and also landing one of the largest vehicles to ever land on the moon,"" he said.

When National Team was asked why it has the best solution to go back to the moon, compared with SpaceX or Dynetics, the group emphasized its heritage dating back to Apollo program lunar-landing systems, scaling up the systems of existing spacecraft (such as the body and solar panels of the Cygnus cargo spacecraft), and an approach that doesn't overburden any one company.

""We are taking the best of those technologies from 50-plus years ago, upgrading them, and ... we're flying it in a much more sustainable and much safer manner,"" Couluris said. ""We're divided among our four parties. Each taking tasks will allow us to divide and conquer, but conquer as a National Team.""

Couluris told Business Insider during the panel that the team offers ""the best opportunity for the country to make it in as soon as possible"" to the moon.

""You have four partners with more experience than most, not only in the country but in the world, working together in a very efficient manner, not a bloated manner,"" he said. ""We are producing hardware and results that we will be able to show, going into the next phase, that we have a viable solution that will return the country to the moon.""",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hgb9fw/jeff_bezos_blue_origin_thinks_it_can_beat_spacex/fw5djyx/

It actually, is the dominating rocket in the world is reusable. Almost all new commercial rockets are being reusable (Including Blue Origin and Rocket labs), only legacy rocket manufacturers and governments are clinging to their old ways

&gt;Also reusability does drastically reduce the payload.

No is doesn't... 25% is not what we call ""drastically reduce the payload"" and even if it did just build a bigger rocket (Falcon Heavy)

&gt;Reuse of the Falcon 9 without serious refurbishment for dozens of launches has not been demonstrated yet.

You don't need ""dozens"" of reuses to be economical.

&gt;How eager Elon is to abandon the Falcon 9 makes me wonder if it will be.

As I said it doesn't need to be! Just a reminder that F9 was not particularly built to be reusable, and definitely not reusable the way it is today, so it's a feat that it was able to at all. Starship and New Glenn are made for reuse!

&gt;The engine is one tiny part of the Starship system.

The first flown Full Flow Stage Combustion Engine in the history of humankind is NOT a ""tiny part"".  Many thought it was technically unachievable especially for a company of the size of SpaceX. It's in my opinion the most difficult and risky part in this entire program.

&gt;What you're saying is the same thing as once the SSME was devloped the rest of the Space shuttle was easy and cheap because all the basic technologies, techniques, and economics of reusability had been demonstrated.

Na I'm absolutely not saying that! I'm saying that almost everything has been done before except a functioning FFSC engine.

&gt;You mention the costly refurbishment of the Space Shuttle, seeing as Starship is slowly evolving into something like the Space Shuttle

How has Starship evolved into as Scuttle like program? It's literally made in a dirt field!

&gt;I'm curious how often tiles will need to be replaced and how vulnerable the moveable fins will be to damage.

For the Moon version they won't need any of these. That's the subject here right? And I doubt they would use fins and tiles that need replacing after every flight.

&gt;I think it's ludicrous because I'm not convinced the Starship system, as currently invisioned, will even work.

As I said show me a show stopper?

&gt;We've seen this before from Spacex with the fully resuable Falcon 9. Sure it's possible but it's not worth it and they dropped it.

As I said F9 wasn't even supposed to be reusable! So this comparison is moot!

&gt;Same with propulsive landing of the Dragon 2.

The engines are pretty mature now, the tank construction is nearly there, and booster reuse should be straightforward adaptation of work done on F9. Even the tanker flights don't require second stage reuse to be a thing financially, Starships manufacturing cost is low enough SpaceX can afford to throw a few tankers away (especially if expendability allows more propellant delivered per launch) and still be ~5x cheaper for the entire campaign than the next-cheapest launch vehicle (not even counting the lander itself).

&gt;How little attention refueling gets seems weird to me.

I don't think it's weird.

A 1.5 stage vehicle with everything except a couple drop tanks is almost certainly cheaper than an (initially) mostly-expendable 3 stage vehicle developed by 3 major companies (2 being expensive oldspace companies). We already saw the National Team had the most expensive bid for this early development phase by far, and that gap will likely widen in the operational phase. ALPACA also has far easier access to the crew cabin from the ground, easier unloading of large cargo, and no must-work separation events or ignitions of untested engines. And methalox is probably more ISRU friendly than hydrolox+hypergols (long term Blue has an advantage if they go for a single-stage Blue Moon derived hydrolox lander, but that's years off).

Only way I see ILV having a shot is if NASA decides to fund all 3 vehicles wuthout a downselect.

Well the question of how economical it all is is still up in the air and far from settled. Also reusability does drastically reduce the payload. Reuse of the Falcon 9 without serious refurbishment for dozens of launches has not been demonstrated yet. How eager Elon is to abandon the Falcon 9 makes me wonder if it will be.

BlueOrigin,"They were plenty of people saying it wasn't technically feasible without cripeling payload penalty and costly refurbishment ala Space Shuttle. A lot still pretend today that it's not economically viable.

Same goes for Starship, people are going to say after the fact that off course it was feasible, and give some other reason for dismissing it moments before going bankrupt.

For me the main question to ask is are there any show stoppers for Starship? Personally I don't see any. The hardest item was the Full Flow Stage Combustion Engine, and that seems to be the most functional part so far. Next are the belly flop landing maneuver (has been demonstrated before) and whatever heatshield they come up with. But none of those are used for the moon lander.

So basically beside the Raptor engines that's already working fine and despite what everybody's saying it's quite a strait forward system.

BlueOrigin,"Is it?

There are mission requirements: e.g. lunar transfer, entry, landing, launch and return. These requirements can be met by one vehicle - in which case it needs to be a jack-of-all-trades, or separate ones - in which case they can specialise. If the latter, you can optimise them for their purpose, but you need to define the interfaces between them. Then each team can design appropriately - which is especially advantageous if the companies have a track record in that area. This worked rather well with Apollo (e.g. SI-C, SII and S-IVB et all all designed and manufactured by different companies).

As Boeing have learnt recently, the interfaces are important. But modern Boeing have shown themselves to be rather poor in this respect, and that does not invalidate the concept.

However, this black-boxing is what happens in engineering anyway. The team designing the landing legs of Moonship don't need to know the technicalities of the entire ship, but only things that affect them, for instance landing weight and vector / speed.

SpaceX's approach has some advantages. IMO they are not clear-cut advantages. What it requires is good management skills to manage those interfaces between the teams - and this includes someone who can overrule them all.

As an aside, the Falcon 9's landing legs were initially designed by a motor-racing team. I've no idea if they still are, but at least Dan lived to see it. A case of SpaceX having to integrate another company's design.

BlueOrigin,"My take (opinion) on this:

Blue will win HLS contract, but SpaceX will still get funding for Starship, bc of its more than competitive pricing. 

Both Systems need docking, refueling to be effective. 

America team is more conservative

Starship will be very effective for cargo, habs, base logistics

Blue Lander for modular missions, scout operations, telescopes, rovers, etc

Dynetics still has chances (not as complicated as Team Blue, ""just"" needs drop tanks)

BlueOrigin,"Thanks for clarifying that, I was wondering if they didn't make the cut or just stopped trying. 

I wonder why? This article was dated from Aug 9, 2012. 
Some of Blue's news posts like this one from Feb 2013 suggested they would continue development but in an unfunded capacity: https://www.blueorigin.com/news/blue-origin-to-complete-more-milestones-for-spacecraft-development

Then this post from Dec 2013 suggests they still planned to use BE-3 for their orbital vehicle (initially New Glenn was all BE-4): https://www.blueorigin.com/news/blue-origin-debuts-the-american-made-be-3-liquid-hydrogen-rocket-engine


In my opinion their ""Gradatim Ferociter"" motto is total BS. They've radically changed their rockets and plans several times now, shelving entire designs and capabilities. This isn't ""step by step"" its ""start, give up, walk away, then try something different later"". In the oft cited tortoise and the hare metaphor Blue Origin is far more like the hare, running ahead and then stopping to take a break and getting passed by other (ahem SpaceX). Passed by companies that continue to iterate and improve on their vehicles step by step rather than making these radical changes every few years.

New Goddard -  a test vehicle like grasshopper powered by BE-1 peroxide engines. Very little commonality with future vehicles.

New Shepard - originally a 3 engine BE-2 kerosene/peroxide powered rocket. Completely discarded after a few test flights and redesigned as the single engine BE-3 hydrolox vehicle we are all familiar with. Was the original vehicle so under performing that it couldn't have been salvaged?

Orbital Transport System (OTS) rocket - a 5(?)xBE-3 powered reusable booster and BE-3 upper stage, likely Soyuz like lift capabilities, completely dropped. 

Orbital Crew Capsule - dropped out of NASA's Commercial Crew Integrated Capability initiative. Whatever happened to the plans for this vehicle is anyone's guess.

New Glenn (aka ""Big Brother"") - originally conceived to fly with a BE-4U upper stage and a 3 stage variant, then changed to 2xBE-7 two stage vehicle with the 3rd stage removed from all but a small ""reserved""mention in their users guide. There was even some hints that suggest when they first decided to use BE-4 for their booster it was a much smaller vehicle

Could the old OTS rocket design have been commercially viable? Maybe, Soyuz still sees some commercial use with Arianespace. Would it have been a step forward to achieve orbit before moving on to bigger vehicles? Absolutely. Could their crew capsule see use as a cargo vehicle in CRS2?  Maybe. Would flying an orbital rocket have built up company experience and trust with customers to better position them further down the road? Absolutely.

June 5, 1977: The first Apple II, an 8-bit home computer and one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, went on sale on June 5, 1977, after being introduced by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at West Coast Computer Faire the April before.

Aug. 3 in 1977
Introduced in August 1977, the TRS 80 was the first complete, pre-assembled small computer system on the market. When the TRS-80 — a personal computer from Tandy that would be sold via their RadioShack stores, hence TRS — went on sale on Aug. 3 in 1977

In Australia at the time, Tandy had a fairly significant presence, and so I remember the TRS 80, As the first personal computer to become available.

Although I first remember Apple for a small column advert I saw in the September 1977 of Scientific American....
https://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/sa/1977/09-01/

I remember that was a pretty amazing issue as it was all about micro electronics, and it had a very prophetic article about microelectronics and the personal computer. I remembered the advert for the apple II Might have been part of that article. Apple have been very lucky to have survived to this date, as there were many occasions in which they could've gone the way of Tandy, and Commodore. What save them was the anti-trust case brought against Microsoft by the US government, that Steve Jobs was not able to make the Next Computer a Runaway sales hit, and Apple at that time were hitting a brick wall in trying to develop a new operating system, and they found the NextStep was what they needed. By that stage, John Sculley had left, and more realistic management had come into Apple. in 1997, they were really screwed. At that stage I was working for a software company developing Mac-based accounting software, and the market Was shrinking almost daily. Microsoft had no choice but to keep Apple alive, or the US government would have ""Pico-Softed"" them, and broken them up.

SpaceX and blue origin are the Microsoft versus apple of our time, And Elon musk he's doing what he can to align himself with Donald Trump, to make a case to break up Amazon (I personally hold no stock in Amazon, and I am agnostic to this company), But you can bet Elon musk is probably having sleepless nights about blue origin right now with the New Glenn.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hdvt07/spacex_vs_blue_origin_who_will_win_the_space_race/fvtejpc/

BlueOrigin,"Here is an old slideshow I found from when Blue Origin was participating in the commercial crew development program.

So much has changed since then.

New Shepard was powered by 3x BE-2 engines.

Their orbital rocket was a reusable booster powered by a cluster of BE-3 engines with an expendable BE-3 powered upper stage. 

Finally there was a biconic composite structure crew capsule in development that would fly up to 7 crew to the ISS. 

We've all seen the changes to the rockets - whatever happened to the crew capsule plans?

But that was 2013 or even more long ago. Since then both New Sheppard and New Glenn have changed completely - who knows what happened to the capsule.

I'm uncertain about this and at least don't share your apparent confidence in this.

And New Glenn is coming along, albeit slowly.

&gt; New Glenn is in the same class as Falcon Heavy which already has three launches whereas it's unlikely that New Glenn will be ready for the 2024 Artemis missions.

I agree that it seems unlikely that New Glenn will be ready to fly with crew in 2024, but that's still far away from the end of the decade. Also, note that Falcon Heavy has never been person-rated and likely never will be.

Race to dominate commercial &amp; government launch industry? Without any orbital launch Blue's VERY behind but their investment in facilities suggests they intend to compete. We will see how NSSL goes, but I have my doubts on Blue's chances.

Then we have development of space resources where Blue isn't saying squat.

Lol",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hc4y9y/blueorigin_fantastic_news_and_we_applaud_your/fvf70dj/
BlueOrigin,"Most people in the discussion appear to think the mention of astronauts is of orbital astronauts, and that's why they're talking about training and not experiments. NASA announced a while ago that they were willing to fly experimenters for experiments that couldn't be automated. Generally that involves an expert that isn't an orbital astronaut.

All in all, mixing sub-orbital and orbital causes a lot of confusion.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hc4y9y/blueorigin_fantastic_news_and_we_applaud_your/fveu8zw/
BlueOrigin,"The real reason is that New Shepard provides ~5 min of *extremely* clean microgravity, which really is only comparable to drop towers or the ISS.  Zero-G planes are a great resource, but they are still subject to turbulence and how well the pilot maintains the parabolic arc, which for some sensitive experiments is unacceptable. Also, keep in mind some experiments need more than 30 of micro-g to useable data. I imagine flying astronauts on NS to tend to more complicated experiments without paying for an ISS flight seems very compelling to NASA.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hc4y9y/blueorigin_fantastic_news_and_we_applaud_your/fveq086/

BlueOrigin,"Yeah but thats not a high bar.

The ideal would be orbital spaceflight so cheap and straightforward that you don't need astronaut training unless you're doing EVAs (inherently dangerous due to potential for human error). I expect that will exist before New Shepard is flying paying passengers. Crew Dragon is already in service and can support novices with ""only a few weeks"" of training, and Starship is looking likely to exist in another year or 2",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hc4y9y/blueorigin_fantastic_news_and_we_applaud_your/fve9qmj/

A much more authentic experience than the 25 seconds achieved per parabola in the comet.

The next best thing to launching and landing in Starliner or Dragon is going to be doing a suborbital flight test in a similar capsule. It's just something that cannot be recreated in Simulators.

Because we haven't seen any sign of orbital ship so far, I assume there is nothing much to show yet. Less than 5 years from official announcement to first flight would simply be impossible.

BlueOrigin,"&gt;Companies in aerospace sue all the time.

Companies sue all the time, but usually for specific reasons. I'm not saying the suit didn't have any merit, but Blue Origin knew the language of the NSSL selection long before and literally waited until the last day possible to file the suit. That created the longest delay possible. NG, alone, wasn't ready and, win or lose, the timing gave Blue more time to be able to compete. It was an effective strategy, but I'm not accepting ""we move at our own pace"" anymore when your pace slows other things down.

&gt;Remember that time when SpaceX sued the Air Force because they didn't make the LSA cut?(something about their bid being unappealing to the AF). I thought so. Double standards.

SpaceX has received some negative commentary for the suit, so I'm not sure I agree about double standards. If SpaceX had bid a modified Falcon 9/FH with Raptor engines like the USAF had been interested in, they probably would've won an LSA slot and the suit would never have been filed (regardless of merit). That's on them. However, they didn't sue to slow the process down and they don't have a history of being slow.

Sorry about that, it's a bad habit. Somehow I always think of more to say after pressing submit, and I usually just hope people haven't replied yet. So, that's definitely my bad, and I apologize.

I'd say I'm a SpaceX fan, but I'll be thrilled if New Glenn becomes a huge success, and if you check my post history you'll find I'm actually very skeptical about SpaceX's Starship and how tough it's going to be to make that work. (Edit: I tend to be nice about it though, and I do want it to succeed, obviously. Just saying, I don't feel like I'm a blind fanboy.)

I appreciate your point about stability. I just don't feel like I have anywhere near the information I'd need to really have an idea about how big of an effect that would have.

It is part of Blue Origin's strategy to be able to launch in a greater variety of weather conditions. There is no question that a large, moving ship will offer significantly better stability than a flat barge. Higher speed are an advantage, as it allows for shorter turnaround speeds. Blue Origin also plans to land their boosters much further from the coast. 

It's clear that you just don't want to admit to any advantages that this type of platform might offer - hell, it seems you won't even admit that it's physically larger than the spacex barges.

BlueOrigin,"&gt; and for the record, the landing platform on the ship will be wider than the ship itself.

I explicitly mentioned that:

&gt; A lot of that length is not usable for landing, but the landing platform will probably extend out from the sides of the ship quite a bit.

I figure a little over half the full length would be usable for landing, and that the landing platform would be less than twice the width of the ship. That gives about the same size landing platform as SpaceX's drone ship. I think both are pretty reasonable rough estimates.

As for stability, okay, but I feel like there are a *lot* of unknown factors. For one, I haven't seen anyone actually quantify how much more stable it is. And we don't know much about New Glenn's center of gravity or how capable its landing legs are relative to F9. Basically, I don't want to argue about this point. If you feel like this is a clear advantage, fine.

The speed of the platform though is kind of meaningless. If SpaceX can have 3 drone ships out to sea for the same price of Blue Origin's one, the advantage probably goes to SpaceX just because of redundancy and flexibility.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/h7bmxe/ship_tonight/fulmpbc/

It is also a much faster platform, meaning that the rocket can be recovered more rapidly from greater distances.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/h7bmxe/ship_tonight/fulk121/
BlueOrigin,"It actually isn't.

The landing platform of SpaceX's drone ship is [52 m × 91 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_spaceport_drone_ship), while the size of Blue Origin's landing ship is [25.5 m x 182.8 m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin_landing_platform_ship). A lot of that length is not usable for landing, but the landing platform will probably extend out from the sides of the ship quite a bit.

BlueOrigin,"Hell ya! Exactly. 

Cost per ton delivered!!!",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gz4sjd/the_costsaving_success_of_commercial_crew_is/ftelngx/
BlueOrigin,"The National Team actually has a great deal of payload flexibility just not when it is in the manned configuration. Without the assent stage it has about 4500 kg to the lunar surface and the ability to provide electricity through a lunar night with fuel cells. There are at least two lunar telescope ideas that require the main mass of the telescope to be in the middle of a 3-5 km crater which is not a easy place to get to if you need to land outside it and then move several tons of equipment. 

 [https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2020\_Phase\_I\_Phase\_II/lunar\_crater\_radio\_telescope/](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2020_Phase_I_Phase_II/lunar_crater_radio_telescope/) 

The Lunar Farside Radio Telescope would be the best way possible to probe into radio bands that simply can't be heard anywhere else in cislunar space. There isn't an easy way to do construction on this with people in big and bulky space suits. You need a deep and steep sided crater for it to be useful which requires rovers to get up and down it anyway. Having extra tons on the outer rim of the crater and human hands simply is of very limited usefulness.

 [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0806/0806.2241.pdf](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0806/0806.2241.pdf) 

Putting a liquid mirror telescope on the moon lets you do a sky survey in the visible to infrared spectrum with telescopes in the +10m size without  all the issues of grinding and aligning mirrors. They don't need a crater  with as steep of sides as the the radio telescope but you also very much don't want any rocket launches near the telescope post deployment. Coating your liquid mirror with moon dust is in general what you are trying to avoid. So the Blue Moon lander is good for putting the telescope payload in the crater even if you are going to have Spaceship lands outside the crater to set up the power and communications station and help deploy the telescope. 

When all you want is to get to the surface without crew and do cool science then the national team is the best. You just have a big empty space on top where the assent stage was that you can do what you want with and piggy back off what ever systems you need that are on the lander to have even more payload. 

It can even be turned into a reusable hauler for what you want to get off the surface  once ISRU is set up.  That stuff can even be people as once you don't need the assent stage because of refueling you can replace the assent module with a can to put humans with life support in. 

Dynetics is a perfect lander if you simply want to put humans on the surface of the moon at various locations. It is better at that then all the other lander. If you want to do stuff on the moon long term then the SpaceX and National Team start looking much better.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gcehjg/zubrin_my_take_on_artemis_landers_bluelm_loxh2/fteiuqf/

I lost a beer bet to a mate about who would launch people first (destination not relevant), SX or BO, because it feels like BO has been ready to fly people for a while now. Is the one more flight to pass some sort of qualification? or is it just that they have payloads for the next mission so no room for people?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gw9wyt/this_is_too_slow/ft9roh9/
BlueOrigin,"5 years minimum you think? I'd call that pretty optimistic tech wise to overtake spaceX. Overtake means they have to reach a point ahead of where SpaceX will be in 5 years time. Even if spaceX downed tools today and did nothing BO doesn't even catch up to them for a couple years yet, and as far as I can see what BO is currently working on is going to be effectively equivalent to the existing FH offering (ok not entirely true, but similar). SX is already working on N+1, BO is still at N-1.     

10 years is more likely timeframe, but at this stage 10 years in the future who knows what will happen. 10 years ago both SX and BO were minnows.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gx3u13/teslas_elon_musk_calls_for_breakup_of_amazon_in/ft9qgwv/

BlueOrigin,"Internal. It’s cost accounting. Companies always want to know what the cost utility of an asset is. If a project is using more of a resource vs what is expected then an audit can be done to determine if resources are being misused or if the project is not as simply not as productive as expected. Judgments can then be made to make new investments or to reallocate the projects assets (ie axe the project). Or if a project is over producing then it’s resources can be reallocated to other areas. Cost accounting is a core component of this. It’s basically understanding how your business pays itself internally from department to department.!or even in the assembly of a product, how the cost of each item impacts the total cost of the good. 

I don’t know amazons practices. But they may apply a discount rate for services, or they may use the standard rate that anyone would pay. I would assume they use a discount rate, but that’s just a hunch.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gx3u13/teslas_elon_musk_calls_for_breakup_of_amazon_in/ft4b31j/

BlueOrigin,"Don't agree. The anticompetitive nature of Amazon doesn't come from the fact that it operates across multiple industries i.e. AWS - cloud, Amazon Retail - ecommerce, Amazon Prime - entertainment. This is just a standard conglomerate as far as I can tell. Would you advocate breaking up Berkshire Hathaway just because they're in the business of making food (Heinz), insurance (Gekko), and fast food (Dairy Queen)? 

No, the anticompetitive nature for Amazon comes from the fact, at least for Amazon Retail, they're both a market and sell direct on the platform. So if you're a small entrepreneur and come up with a new product (e.g. a new type of instant pot), then Amazon will have the data that says this thing sells well, copy your product by creating an Amazon basics version, and then market that on their platform more highly than your original product.

Now to normal anti-trust law this is not anticompetitive as prices have gone down. So all's well. However, this discourages innovation as the next entrepreneur that's thinking about creating a new product won't do so. Thereby stifling innovation.

TLDR: Amazon is not anticompetitive because it competes across a broad array of industries, just as any other conglomerate would. No, Amazon is anticompetitive as it serves as both the platform with Amazon marketplace as well as competing directly on that same platform with its own products.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gx3u13/teslas_elon_musk_calls_for_breakup_of_amazon_in/ft2rmw6/

Love him or hate him, Elon’s not the only one advocating for Amazon to get the King Solomon’s Baby treatment. 

As for how you do it.

AWS  (could become a communications giant) 
Retailer (where they started)
Entertainment services (prime streaming) 
Basics (the stuff they sell) 

This would be great for shareholders of the company. As the parts would be worth more than the whole. Some value AWS at &gt;$500bil on its own in its current state. Prime streaming could grow into a $200-300 bil
 Netflix/Spotify competitor if it had to actually compete. The Basics brand sells everything. So they could go into more distribution channels and grow in value. And Amazon the retailer would still be worth &gt;$500bil. So investors come out ahead. The market gets more competitive. And Amazons not a behemoth that bully’s new startups from entering.

BlueOrigin,"&gt; Clay Mowry(VP of Sales, Marketing &amp; Customer Experience)  has said that they have priced it incredibly cheap and aim New Glenn to be lowest price per kg rocket in the market.

Makes sense. A high flight rate is pretty important for a reusable rocket.

I do wonder how much of the low cost / kg is because of dual-launch capability though, because that has its own downsides for customers, and it really doesn't help if you want a high flight rate.

Long run, they need something that can absorb spare launch capability, like Starlink is to SpaceX. I think many people expect Amazon's Project Kuiper to be that customer for Blue Origin. It may be a little more awkward though because Amazon is a separate and publicly traded company.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gwn3gc/launch_cost/fsybt2x/
BlueOrigin,"&gt; Its widely expected that Bezos will do what he normally does, which is to price to undercut the competition regardless of the true cost, and bleed money until achieving profitability through sheer scale.

I could believe the bleeding money part (he's already doing it in a sense), but the launch market seems pretty price inelastic: SpaceX has lowered launch costs pretty dramatically since they've entered the market, and launch volumes haven't increased that much. Maybe pushing prices down even further will stimulate growth, but I wouldn't bet that way.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gwn3gc/launch_cost/fsy4ebz/

BlueOrigin,"I just went through the hiring process for a machine operator position. The interview process was pretty involved.
First there was a phone screen from an HR/talent acquisition rep, it was easy. Then there was a phone interview (~20 minutes) from a leader in the department you're applying for. Then they scheduled an in person interview (actually a skype interview due to covid) with a panel of people in your department. For me it was the department head and 4 other workers. You have prepare an essay based on a prompt they give you. You have to give a 30 minute powerpoint presentation to the panel basically selling yourself and your resume. Then a 30 minute one-on-one interview with each of the panel members. For me the in-person interview/presentation took 3 hours total.

I applied twice and went through the whole process twice. My first try was before covid and the in-person interview included a factory tour. 

It took slightly longer to hear back about the interview than they told me it would, but I still think it was a pretty rapid response.
Good luck buddy the presentation and speech part was rough but once you prepare it you can reuse it if you need to re-apply later.

BlueOrigin,Good explanation. You sound like someone who knows a lot about this stuff.,/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gwn3gc/launch_cost/fsx1l4q/
BlueOrigin,"It's not an easy 1 to 1.

FH with regular fairing can't fit dual launch GEO sats and in all booster reuse doesn't have that much GTO payload to really justify doing so.

New Glenn can do the dual slot business plan like Ariane, meaning it can be more expensive on a per launch basis but cheaper per kg delivered to GTO.

For other orbits it's also going to vary. It will also depend on if the extended FH fairing happens and allows it to not be so heavily volume constrained for LEO. As is New Glenn should be able to carry a lot more to LEO for something like an internet constellation just because of volume.

I expect there will be pockets in the market where each one has a competitive advantage on price. New Glenn definitely is not optimal for scaling downwards when measured against the combination of F9 and Heavy.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gwn3gc/launch_cost/fswzgvy/
BlueOrigin,[deleted],/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gwn3gc/launch_cost/fswxjh2/
BlueOrigin,This sounds right. Has to be significantly cheaper than falcon heavy,/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gwn3gc/launch_cost/fswsprm/

I predict that most people will be shocked with how cheap it is when the official price is released. 

Bob Smith the CEO has said that 75% of the cost will be reduced due to first stage reuse.

 Clay Mowry(VP of Sales, Marketing &amp; Customer Experience)  has said that they have priced it incredibly cheap and aim New Glenn to be lowest price per kg rocket in the market.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gwn3gc/launch_cost/fswmtik/
BlueOrigin,"Tory Bruno's rules of thumb haven't been applicable to the only company actually reusing an orbital rocket. For F9, engines are closer to 15% of the cost of the booster, the booster is about 60% of the rocket, and the rocket is &gt;95% of the launch service price (for a launch with a new and/or expendable booster. With reuse, price is largely profit). So clearly there is some variation here.

This will depend a lot on the company's structure and target market.

Merlin is very cheap compared to the booster as a whole because its produced in greater volume (9 per booster, plus 1 for each upper stage). And ULA buys all its engines, so theres another later of profit margin and administrative overhead inflating the engine cost relative to the (slightly more vertical) tank/structure/plumbing.

For the launch service as a whole, ULAs primary customers are the government, typically with a lot of extra requirements. The 50% figure was in reference to a typical ULA mission, not the cheapest they can go, and we've seen theres a 40+ million dollar difference in the prices for an equivalent capability launch for commercial vs government flights, both from ULA and SpaceX.

Plus, as rockets get cheaper, there's more incentive to reduce the cost of providing those services. Makes no sense to sell a 5 million dollar flight with a 10 million dollar integration fee. Horizontal integration of a 2 stage rocket is cheaper than vertical integration of a 2 stage rocket with SRBs. Methalox is cheaper than hydrolox or kerolox. Automated trajectory design is cheaper than doing it by hand (which ULA still does). AFTS is cheaper both in personnel and equipment than normal range safety. Automated vehicle checkouts are cheaper than manually validating telemetry. Robotically-actuated interfaces all plugging into the base of the booster is cheaper than dozens of manual connections up and down both stages on an umbilical tower. Liquid engines don't destroy launch sites on every flight like SRBs. Etc etc etc. All of these have been known for ages, but only recently became economically relevant to vehicle design as other costs fell.

Overall I'd expect the service cost to be closer to F9 than Atlas currently (though ULA is improving too with Vulcan). Horizontal integration, no solids, we've heard they're aiming for a highly automated mission design and rollout, and most customers will probably be commercial.

The relative complexity of BE-4 vs Merlin (ORSC), and lower production volume (only 2 or 7 per booster with a smaller expected fleet size, and no expendable ones), will likely drive up the engine cost as a fraction of booster cost though. But I still don't expect it anywhere near 2/3.

For the second stage, I think the closest analog is probably Ariane 6s core stage. Both are hydrolox stages, with similar volume, and at least initially a similar production cadence. 2 BE-3Us is likely cheaper than 1 Vulcain 2.1 though, given the simpler design. That'd put cost at more like 40 million dollars for S2.

Anyway, to some extent the cost of New Glenn is somewhat arbitrary. Its widely expected that Bezos will do what he normally does, which is to price to undercut the competition regardless of the true cost, and bleed money until achieving profitability through sheer scale. Plus a large number of flights will likely be for Blue or Amazon. The only concern for cost then is how much Bezos is willing to spend to subsidize it in the near term",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gwn3gc/launch_cost/fswiypl/
BlueOrigin,"Well, if they spread the 63 million for the booster over 25 flights, it comes to about 2,5 million extra for each flight. There is still so much unknown that we can't really make accurate predictions for cost yet.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gwn3gc/launch_cost/fsw6sxp/
BlueOrigin,"Yes, but booster is design for 25 flights",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gwn3gc/launch_cost/fsw5es2/
BlueOrigin,"No no he won't.

Putting aside that recent RAND study which showed that in the history of the human race and rockets, no rocket that was 12 or more months out was EVER on time. 

It'll take them some time to work out the kinks with New Glenn, and as we're all painfully aware, Blue is anything but speedy. 

They're also gonna need to get all their hardware man-rated - which takes alot of time AFTER the hardware exists.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gw9wyt/this_is_too_slow/fsw4sub/
BlueOrigin,"Alright, everything I'm going to say is purely speculation but here goes. The RD-180 costs somewhere around 10 million each. BO has said that the BE-4 will cost about 40% less. 

According to Tory Brunos rule of thumb, rocket is roughly 1/2 of launch service cost, booster is 1/2 of the rocket and engines are 2/3 of the booster.

Assuming the BE-4 cost 6 million, the booster would cost around 63 million, the rocket would cost 126 million and the whole thing would cost 252 million.

Now Blue Origin plans on reusing the first stage. If we drop the booster price out of the equation, a single launch would cost around 190 million.

That number sounds kind of reasonable but again purely speculation.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gwn3gc/launch_cost/fsw49qq/

BlueOrigin,"When will Blue Origin Stadium be complete in San Diego? I hope Mr. Bezos is able to purchase the Chargers from the Spanos family. What a great Super Bowl venue it will be. 

Blue skies, blue ocean, Blue Origin Stadium. I hope he partners will Legoland down the street. It will be cool to see a life size New Glenn rocket made of Legos at the Amusement park. The Club For The Future would grow exponentially!

Would Bezos sell rides to space from the stadium? Perhaps use NFL ticket stubs as raffle tickets for a ride to go to space? Give everyone a chance to go to space... 

It would be fun if Blue Origin sent up a giant bag of deflated Super Bowl footballs to space and used them in the inaugural Super Bowl at Blue Origin Stadium. (could retrieve air from life support systems aboard New Sheppard capsule to fill the footballs at the Stadium).

It makes sense to choose San Diego. The rocket that sent John Glenn around the Earth in orbit, was designed and built in San Diego. Jeff Bezos is enshrined at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

It's time to put space travel in the ether. Grab the kids and sports fans and never let them go. Make them space fans for life. Make it so Jeff Bezos!",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gw1v4d/factory_at_kennedy_space_center_is_pretty_much/fssybxi/

BlueOrigin,"&gt; It might be easier/cheaper to use a known ""tank"" shape that's strong and works than design a new one just to match the rest of the lander. 

Are you suggesting that the ""known tank shape "" is a bolt-on from some other project rather than being designed/built from scratch for this lander? 

Anyways What I'm asking about is still a cylinder.  It's just got a bigger diameter compared to its length, and it's oriented vertically rather than horizontally.  And it's not like [vertical cylinders](https://newcontent.westmarine.com/content/images/catalog/1500/1593995_1500.24102018023007.jpg) are [unknown](https://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.23348964.1530040232!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_804/water-tower.png).

BlueOrigin,"We don't know exactly what NGs launch commit criteria will be, but Blue has advertised that it'll be capable of launching in a wide array of conditions compared to other rockets, and F9 is basically on the complete other end of the spectrum (like flying a noodle).

But since the constraint for last time was lightning related (which can be mitigated, but isn't much related to the basic architecture of the vehicle so no obvious advantage for Blue), and the big risk for today was weather in the abort zones (would require the New Glenn capsule to have considerable crossrange and propulsive landing to totally eliminate. Which I don't expect it to), probably not. And, for a partially expendable rocket that can only fly a few dozen times a year and will only occasionally carry passengers, it doesn't really matter. Delays don't cost much money relative to the service overall, and the customers can easily tolerate them.

It would be enough if the goal was just to support a couple billion people at roughly the average standard of living we see today, but thats a pretty unambitious goal. Doesn't scale to trillions of people at per-capita energy use orders of magnitude higher than even our wealthy today.

Space elevators aren't a great idea though, even the theoretical cost per kg (electricity only, nothing else) to orbit with them is nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than the all-in cost SpaceX is planning for reusable rockets, and the total global launch capacity would be several orders of magnitude lower.

Rocket travel is more environmentally friendly than air travel. Starship will pollute less per passenger per km traveled (for E2E missions) even when using fossil methane, and the long term plan is to produce methane at the launch site via the sebatier process (carbon neutral as long as solar is used for power production)",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gluar0/how_the_latest_x37b_mission_may_change_the_world/fr52mwd/

Space solar power is for those who like their science fiction to be space elevators. Great idea, now how the fuck do you build it? Or Dyson sphere... I think it should be left there... together with flying cars. We will have more important things to do in space, this is one of them.

Zero chance this ever gets beamed down back to Earth, it was just an idea floated. Most likely it will be for powering drones/satellites in space without the massive reflective solar panels to give them away on radar easily.  In space your RF losses will be as close to vacuum as you can naturally get, perfect application.

Also one I've calculated before for uses.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gluar0/how_the_latest_x37b_mission_may_change_the_world/fr42geg/
BlueOrigin,"The usual answers to this are

1. Giant collectors isolated from habitable regions by a large distance. You're not gonna have a reciever on your house. Though it'll probably still be a several-kilometer-wide bird roaster

2. Just build the satellites even bigger and accept the efficiency loss. The main justification for space solar power (outside a few very niche applications) is not that it allows cheaper energy production at current utilization, but that it allows a larger total energy consumption than is physically possible with solar panels on Earth. Can have orders of magnitude more collection area beamed down to a small amount of land

3. See 2.

I'm still not convinced though. I love the idea of space solar power, I don't love the idea of transmitting that power. Use that energy in space instead. Orbital datacenters would be an obvious near-term application, in that a huge chunk of global energy consumption is dedicated to them already so more efficient production plus larger total capacity can be very attractive. Later on, manufacturing, since it seems likely that the bulk of manufacturing (and consumption of those manufactured goods) will be off Earth anyway in the long term. If we can take all non-personal computing and industry to orbit, the power production needed on Earth itself is negligible",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gluar0/how_the_latest_x37b_mission_may_change_the_world/fr3nff1/

BlueOrigin,"As a former RF engineer my issues with this are:

1. High power RF is not safe, especially microwave energy. Just hot wire the door of your microwave over and open it and see what it will do to you, and that is only 600 watts...
2. At what frequency will these solar power satellites transmit at? This is because the higher the frequency the higher the atmospheric attenuation, especially due to water vapor absorption. As these satellites would have to be in Clarke orbits, these losses can be significant, and from memory in the order to 20-30 dB... and remember a 3dB loss means you halve your received power.. and so you would have to divide your transmitted power by 1024 to 32 768 to understand how much power would be available to the receiver...[https://paginas.fe.up.pt/\~ee97054/Transmission%20Losses.pdf](https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~ee97054/Transmission%20Losses.pdf)
3. How efficient will the receiving antenna system be?

Overall, not a very efficient system, when you transmit a 1MW of RF, and in the end, you only wind up with enough power to run 30 toasters \[at a 1KW each...\]....

Virgin Galactic a rival is worth over $3billion so there is no way Blue Origin is worth less than that. Blue has much larger revenues that Virgin. For example, Blue has billions of dollars worth of contracts( Nasa and Airforce already make up over $1.1billion in contracts) ULA has said their contract with Blue is worth billions in its entirety, and then you have Blue’s contracts to launch Telesat constellation, Eutelsat, Sky Jsat, Maxar and other contracts, not to mention the possible Project Kuiper contract and the current New Shepard’s payloads/NASA tipping point contracts that bring in millions.

You may take a pay cut, although these days with your experience, you may command in the 30/hr range, but I'm basing this on my starting pay over 10 years ago in California.  They start everyone off as a contractor so they can dump you if you suck.  Sounds like you'd be just fine.  It's a lot cleaner that airplanes, and you'll work in ""clean rooms"".  Hardware is much smaller, parts are more delicate.  Inch pound torque wrenches, not foot pound(unless working on support equipment).  #8 screws, thermal blankets and lots of velcro.  Quality Control were like the cops looking over your shoulder all the time.  If something gets damaged or doesn't match the drawings you talk to engineering, sort of like aviation except there really isn't approved data in a MM ready to go.  You need an engineer to give you a dispo even if you know what the fix should be.

BlueOrigin,"I left for a couple reasons, but primarily because I didn't know how different SpX was from traditional companies, as my first ever job period. I believed, wrongly in hindsight, that aerospace was still like it was decades ago during Apollo or the 80's that the most capable were desirable and not shunned and if you could prove yourself and solve challenges you could make your ticket to a happy career. 3.9+ GPAs are looked at as freaks by recruiters and you don't get interviews even. Boeing seemed to have it all 10 years ago when I started college and really, my expectations of industry are not today's reality. Perhaps my jaded opinion, but today these companies are so large (~160k in Boeing's case) that many people are needed to simply turn the crank on Excel or fill out required paperwork and not think or rock the boat. Hell we're told to not be early or late completing work packages. Late I can understand but early? It's because 6 months ago a panel sat down and estimated the work to do and how many bodies at 40/wk it would take. So now if I finish something early, I have nothing to do because the current work package is done and the next one can't start until the next analysis cycle so I shouldn't be paid technically. It blows my mind how much aerospace changed in the last 40 years.

The safety culture was also lacking in my opinion and this was a few years ago now as Crew was starting to get heavy so it may have changed a bit. The feeling was that something was going to break, like it was just a given based on how designs were done and people expected failures. Systems engineers across disciplines were almost non-existent. Sometimes if a parts batch arrived later at night and had missing paperwork or non-conformances, the techs would go around calling REs for them to accept it at sometimes 2-3am to make production targets. Not good in my view.

Finally, LA was just not for me lifestyle wise. The cost of living compared to my salary was also way out of whack compared to anywhere else I looked. Being frugal with no loans after college still left me with less than $400/month savings and no retirement.

Edit: I should also say that the 'go break anything or piss people off cause we're the best' work culture didn't sit well either. I'm more like BO in that I'd rather not brag but show instead.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gflq0z/have_any_engineers_here_come_from_boeing_very/fq3i0i2/

To be sure, there are changes.

It was the best experience of my life and everyone I talked to seemed to be happy to be there.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gg9748/official_question_and_discussion_thread/fpyx2bf/
BlueOrigin,"I will start by saying that SpX was my first job ever, so I really didn't have a standard to measure it to. Even back to picking a college major I had wanted to work at Boeing and it was difficult to find a job at all after graduation w/o having any internship (long story). I really did not know how traditional aero companies operated so I was naïve about what it could be like inside and as soon as I could get a Boeing GNC position I took it. 

From my almost 4 years so far, I would say most are dislikes unfortunately aside from the fully paid for advanced degrees. Good engineering schools aren't cheap, so that is great and I wouldn't trade my 2nd masters for anything &lt;3. I am a very motivated person from a farming background who doesn't mind working extra hours so long as I am being helpful and playing an important role so the strict 40 hr limit after coming from 60+/week salaried was difficult and sometimes still is. What is this whole time charging every 0.1 hour thing? You mean contract lines have to have money for me to do necessary work and the company doesn't pay me itself? Lol. 

My SpX position also had a lot of responsibility for someone just out of undergrad I felt with code flying in space, giving post flight reviews to the FAA, and writing formal deliverables, etc., but with Boeing I was treated more like an intern with a masters and no experience. What I did was closer to someone with a lvl 3 rating according to the skill codes but without the anniversary years to back it.

I also always finish my work super early to my already high standards and asked for more which confused many like my first manager until I could move finally. 

Finally, the lack of technical challenge is my biggest complaint and really irks me. I've brought it up pretty much since I started and it really feels like there are few expectations for an early career employee until you hit the 5 year mark. I thrive on challenges and being technically capable -- undergrad and both masters had GPAs above 3.9, led a bunch of design teams, and made it my essence to understand everything I could from first principles. I feel like Boeing management likes to talk the talk of hiring the best and being the best in aerospace but my experience has been anything but. A VP recently told me I needed to ride the coming wave of engineering changes for the rest of my career rather than me wanting to create the waves in the first place.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gflq0z/have_any_engineers_here_come_from_boeing_very/fpyfhft/

BlueOrigin,"First of all, do not quit Boeing until you have accepted a better offer. Boeing is surprisingly good at getting employees immersed into proper procedures, whether it is filling out paperwork from change management, getting QA buyoffs before moving to next installation steps, and digging into five layers deep of specs and standards in order to do one thing. The experience you get is substantial when you look back and record everything you've learned and done, even if you currently feel you are pigeon-holed. The negativity bias tends to show more when people are not content with their job.

I would suggest trying to expand your knowledge base by trying to assist with the roles immediately upstream and downstream of what you do now. Put that as a direct goal in your performance review, and name the groups that you want to shadow explicitly. Being a subject matter expert is nice, but you will find that being a SME with knowledge around your particular area will get you hired much more easily.

All good aerospace companies will have some paper pushing as documenting activities and processes is vital for certification and verification activity, and all companies that grow will eventually face some level of bureaucracy. Blue is not an exception, no matter how much everyone wants to romanticize it. Glassdoor reviews trend towards the fact that Blue has moved from being the ""small"" company it once was to one that has moved into actual production, therefore lots of associated paperwork and corporate-isms.

If you are a go getter, self motivated, and a quick learner, you will feel more satisfied with a smaller company (note that pretty much every aerospace company that isn't Boeing will feel much smaller). Yes, Blue might be a good fit for you and you should definitely apply to positions you would feel comfortable with, but really any non-Boeing aerospace company should provide more technical challenges and faster pace.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gflq0z/have_any_engineers_here_come_from_boeing_very/fpxjfte/
BlueOrigin,"Not a BO employee, but working at another new space company, I would say it's definitely not that bad. Depending on what you want to do, there are parts of the my company that are more heavily production based and you get some minor red tape/QA stuff to deal with, but its really not that bad. And it's all for actual flight, so it makes sense. The other side of it is RnD, which is truly the wild west. Barely any tape at all to deal with and its a lot of just go and attack the problems and work with your team of engineers/techs to get things going. Some desk work, but a lot of hands on work building and prepping hardware for testing. I would imagine that since BO is still relatively new, a lot of their work is going to be more of the RnD style of stuff, but there's definitely going to be some stuff to deal with.

BlueOrigin,"&gt; A New Glenn crashing on it shouldn't sink the ship from an impact

Certainly a rocket coming in from 100km accelerating at 1g can sink a ship, even a much smaller rocket than New Glenn and a much larger ship than this one.  That's why SpaceX doesn't line up the booster to land on its barge until late in the approach so that if there is a problem, like an engine cuts out, the booster just crashes into the sea.  As you said its the hover which reduces the energy that is key.  

All that said, it seems riskier to use a ship than a barge.  I assume there will be people onboard when its landing?  That is definitely not the case with the  SpaceX barge.  Also a barge is much cheaper than a ship if it is damaged.  I guess BO figured the advantages of landing stability while underway outweighed the risks.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/geo3f4/per_your_request_pics_of_freighter_docked_in_the/fprqbqh/

BlueOrigin,"A New Glenn crashing on it shouldn't sink the ship from an impact.   Stena Freighter has a gross displacement of some 21,000 metric tons.  The dry mass of the booster landing on it shouldn't be more than 50 tons, and is supposed to be moving slowly (hovering to land is the plan), unlike a supersonic antiship missile with an armor-piercing high-explosive warhead that is hitting a ship at Mach 2 or faster (example the French Exocet).

During critical operations, a ship should have compartmentalized watertight integrity set, so that if an accident happens, only a few compartments might be compromised.  The biggest danger for any ship is if there is a fire, and no doubt they would beef up the firefighting systems on that ship for its intended role.

If a New Glenn crashes on that ship, likely it will put it out of action for a few weeks / couple months while repairs are made.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/geo3f4/per_your_request_pics_of_freighter_docked_in_the/fpq0616/

BlueOrigin,"""The coronavirus pandemic has thrown any number of companies into unpredictability, and Blue Origin is no exception. Jeff Bezos’ space-faring firm racked up a number of successes and losses during this moment, but they’re also using the quarantine to catch up to their more prominent competitors: marketing. Blue Origin has finally opened its own online store, complete with merchandise.

First spotted by GeekWire this week, a company like Blue Origin having its own merch store might not seem like the company’s first priority. And it’s not — founded secretly by Bezos in 2000, but only fully brought to the public’s attention in 2016, the company has long valued its privacy. Its motto is even ""gradatim ferociter,"" which roughly translates from Latin to: ""Step by step, ferociously.""

It’s very much the opposite of Blue Origin’s biggest public competition, SpaceX, whose founder, Elon Musk, keeps the company in the headlines constantly with both professional and personal announcements. It’s a strategy that has mostly paid off for SpaceX, which polling shows is among the most popular companies in the world among millennial men. Musk was even photographed wearing an ""Occupy Mars"" t-shirt produced by the company while holding his newborn son this week.

BlueOrigin,"Hi there, I've done work in the past to calculate various scenarios for space mining. 

Focusing solely on the economic aspect, there are very few metals you can bring to Earth from Space that are economically competitive against just mining them here on Earth. 

There are a few scenarios that are profitable like Helium, but any other you essentially would have to monopolize the market to compete. You either create a large enough volume that you profit from the marginal cost of the material versus selling it, or you bring so little home that it doesn't flood the market and you're not going to be profitable against competitors on Earth because your rocket ship can't even compete with a tractor trailer in terms of weight capacity. 

The most profit driven scenario I can see happening is anything mined in space stays in space and manufacturing centers are created either on the moon or on orbit. That is technology that hasn't been drawn into prototypes yet, let alone left the lab, so a generation or two off.

It will happen eventually, no doubt in my mind. Just that it probably isn't going to take the form most people are envisioning today.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/ge3dq4/blue_origin_oneill_cylinders_and_asteroid_mining/fpmx8m7/
BlueOrigin,"Correct, starting pay with no experience and no school starting pay for any aerospace work is minimum wage.
Throw in an A and P and if you can get yourself at least $30 an hour starting in aerospace manufacturing in WA at the right place.

However I was more so replying to this:

“I don't disagree. Assemblers are far lower income and probably in poverty regardless if we are talking about BO, spaceX, boeing, or Lockheed Martin.”

“Jeff isn't an angel either. Many Amazon workers are in poverty all over America. BO, unfortunately, is no different with entry level/low skill jobs.”

Assemblers at Boeing WERE making quite a bit of money on year 6 (most breaking 6 figures). And those that were entry level or at the bottom of the pay scale worked minimum 5 hours OT a week and got the union contract extension bonus of $5-10k. Far from poverty wages.

Blue doesn’t hire any entry level techs to build the vehicle or build engines. There are very few if any low experience no skill techs at Blue. All techs doing this type of work are very experienced and top of the field. It starts mid 40s and goes up from there. To add to this there are usually signing bonuses, 10-20k. More than the $1-2 that you were off friend.
An exception is they might hire an entry level tech for $20-25 to deburr stuff coming off the 3D printers.

The final part of an interview at blue use to include a rigorous fabrication and assembly test that included interpretations of technical drawings.

Jeff isn’t an angel but there are def opportunities even for the FC workers at amazon.
Prime Air is the holy grail of amazon. It is very confidential. They pay top dollar for the guys doing R and D and those who manufacture the drones. 
Those who work in warehouses can opt to take Friday classes learning robotics manufacturing, repair, or coding to move to a better job with better pay. 
They often give their employees catered lunches and snacks at break throughout the month. It’s not a bad place to work and at the end of the day, no one is forcing you to work there.

BlueOrigin,"So with no experience, as I said, would you say it would be fair to say 18-20/hour? With experience I ball-parked pay at BO and SpaceX above 25/hour (which correlates with what you are saying) and 28-35/hour for more skilled manufacturing work then assembly. 

I was offered 24/hour in midwest with 2 years experience. So 28-29 seems reasonable to low for 10+ years experience. And around 32/hour from SpaceX for the same work in manufacturing (in LA). 

So I guess what I'm saying, is I'm not sure why you said I was wrong in the first place as we are in basically stating the same pay for similar experience. 18/20 dollars an hour was an estimate for basically janitorial work with zero experience in a rocket factory.

BlueOrigin,"We shouldn’t rely on governments taxing mines to protect the environment. That will just cause mining operations to go to countries with lax enforcement and lower taxes. If asteroid/moon mining is intended to save the environment it has to compete on an economic basis with terrestrial mining without subsidies/govt regulation. Which will take a long long time but we’re on our way. First step is to undercut coal mining for the energy sector which is already happening. Sulfur mining for fertilizer (to grow corn to feed beef cows) is probably next to go away as people shift away from eating cattle, maybe.

BlueOrigin,"The case for bringing most materials down to Earth instead of mining them here would be environmental, not economic. Mining is reaaally really bad for the environment. Not just the excavation itself, but tons of toxic waste, and the energy needed to process the material. If space-derived resources can get within, say, 2x the price of Earth ones, we can just tax the hell out of Earth mining and force the adoption of asteroid mining. Same goes for manufacturing, with the added benefit of being able to manufacture some things that just aren't possible in 1g, and if all the manufacturing is in orbit, its silly to bring those materials up from Earth (especially if most of the population is not on Earth)

Anyway, limitless resources doesn't just mean using more of the same stuff we already are.

BlueOrigin,"Even optimistically it's going to be a while before anyone is mining asteroids or the Moon. I wouldn't be concerned about mining the Moon indefinitely - economic costs will likely see a shift to the asteroids long before we come close to removing more than a fraction of the Moon's mass. The Moon itself masses 80,000,000,000,000,000,000.00 tons - if an orbital habitat weighed four million tons, you could build twenty trillion. This is an oversimplification, but the main point is - don't worry about hollowing out the Moon.

It's unlikely that within the next few decades (and likely far longer) we would see anyone bringing raw materials from space down to Earth, with the possible exceptions of helium-3 and platinum-group metals (the latter as a byproduct of mining other raw materials that would be very useful in space). You'd have to compete against a massive industry that's already busily engaged in driving prices down, while surrendering an asteroid's greatest advantages - namely, that everything it has is accessible without needing to enter a high gravity well.

1) I would use .25” margins all the way around, especially the top where you’ve lost a lot of space. 

2) Put your section headers inline with the body text, you’ll gain more writing space despite adding more lines. 

3) Add contact info to your header especially phone number, optionally address.

4) Add more bullets to your experience sections where applicable
 
5) Add your job titles and optionally the location of where the job took place in your experience sections

6) Add one sentence summary of published papers

7) Add a one sentence summary of your personal projects

You seem like you have a lot of impressive stuff, you can have two pages if it allows you to fit good content. (Despite a what lot of people say, almost every resume I get is longer than one page, so if it’s to your advantage, do it. Just make sure it’s not all white space)

BlueOrigin,"These are very valid points, and I guess we will see how their design evolves, and whether they have an auto leveling capability to counter any moment of inertia due to the high centre of gravity of the SS design. 

Another issue is the landing pads themselves, as the NT/BO design has the Apollo style landing pads that help to spread the weight of the vehicle over a wider area to reduce sinkage due to the pressure of the vehicle on the ground surface. The SS design does not appear to have that. 

My other take with the SS design, is that the NT/BO design has the flexible capability to land cargo, and significant sized cargo on the moon.

Basically, it's a way to avoid having to bring with you a shitload of propellant just to get back off whatever rock you're visiting.  In the context of the moon and lunar operations, it's about looking at what propellant systems would be most able to benefit from those resources that are easily found on the moon.  And the answer for the Moon is a hydrogen-oxygen (hydrolox) system because there's water ice on the moon and this can be easily split into H2 and O2 (via electrical hydrolysis or other means).

Sure, BO may be furthest along on their lunar lander, but $4 billion in cost just for the rockets to put the system into TLI is insane given NASA's historic funding. An infeasible plan should definitely lose you more points than being less far along.

I think Dynetics nailed this proposal with their design from an old-space perspective. They minimize risks and proposed a plan that can actually be realistically funded.

SpaceX obviously has more unknowns to overcome, but their development pace has been 3-5x that of Blue &amp; old space historically. To me number of launches is a relative metric rather than an absolute. The agonizing pace of SLS construction makes procuring 4 of those rockets in a rapid time frame very challenging, let alone the $1 billion sticker price per launch.

I would be really interested to see what all they've completed between suppliers, but there is at least a solid design plan and the BE-7 engine is nearing testing, at least according to Blue's website. Comparatively, the Dynetics design has the least complicated launch design that doesn't require refuels or as many docking procedures, but also seems the furthest from operational development out of the options, and the SpaceX design is dependent on the overall Starship and Superheavy development which features a number of unique hurdles and a similar number of launches per mission.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gbzthg/trying_to_understand_how_this_lunar_lander_works/fp8q9m0/

Your perspective appears to be that lunar mining would be for shipping raw materials back to Earth. If you change your focus a bit, its extremely expensive to ship mass to orbit, with most of that mass being propellant. If we can source propellant offworld (and eventually all sorts of other raw materials) we can expand what we can do in space, lower costs, or both.

BlueOrigin,"Yes. It's awesome really how much BE-7 is going to be used. While being almost entirely 3d-printed, its going to be very cheap compared to other hydrogen engines of its class. 2xBE-7 are roughly matching some RL-10 variants in thrust.

Edit :yup
Blue Origin is the prime contractor for the National Team that includes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Draper.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gazhpq/blue_origin_of_kent_washington_is_developing_the/fp2q3dz/
BlueOrigin,"I have so much anticipation for this. But unless this is just an announcement that everyone got contracts for the next phase of development, I cannot confidently foresee a scenario where SpaceX gets an award. National Team is just so far along and is ""safe"" in that way, and Boeing is Boeing and their plan is carefully crafted to target congress's heartstrings. SpaceX either is proposing Starship which satisfies all of Boeing's ""least steps"" but is also much more ambitious, or they are proposing a dragon 2-derived system which would be interesting and would definitely be the wildcard here (though I'm almost certain that's what they proposed).


Sidenote, i'm very satisfied thinking about the whole BS of ""we don't want to dock in lunar orbit because we've never done that"" - DV, while the Apollo LAM and CSM look on in disbelief, and think about how Northrup Grumman can now go ""Well, we are now the premiere autonomous roboting servicing and assembling company with flight experience"" (because apparently we're altogether denying the existence of the international space station when it comes to this decision.). With NG's (pretty much unrelated but whatever this is politics) experience with the MEV, the National Team is derisking more every day.

I belive there is only one Puerto Rican working in Blue rn, at least based on LinkedIn. I can definitly speak more towards that aspect. For example many people say to just work on these amazing projects to expand your experience,which is fine if you live in the states where universities have the money and resources to allow for such work,but in my case my university has very little funds and resources which leads to many innovations on problems with cheap solutions.

It's an engineering company after all - say what you want about their progress - what they care about is results. So focus on the amazing projects you've done, technically sophisticated fixes for crazy things, how you lead your team through a difficult challenge etc.

And don't be afraid to talk about how your unique experiences give you some powerful perspectives - I can't imaging their are tons of people from Puerto Rico interning with Blue atm.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/gag12x/applied_for_fall_internship_position_resume/fp10x1h/
BlueOrigin,"Thank you for the reccomendations! I completely agree with all of that although I've gotten mixed opinions from different recruiters about whether or not to leave the GPA in if it's low.

Couple of things with this resume.

1. Delete your high school information
2. Condense relevant course more, taking way too much space, also course number should be taken out and only include the title.
3. More numbers! Designed to what temperature, what pressure and stuff like that. Numerical stuff let you have more discussion.

For general aspects thats true and I will definitely try to fit that in , but for this application at least i explained the project in much greater detail inside the application form itself where it asked for a detailed description of one of my projects and my role in it.

Yeah youre right i just didn't know how to phrase it but ""HTML"" is better indeed. Although it is technically a programming language fyi. Don't know if I will ever have a need for it but i know that much jaja

""HTML coding"" is not a software and HTML is not a programming language either. I would just call it ""HTML"" (which is still not a software, but at least it isn't completely out of place in that list).

BlueOrigin,"As others have pointed out, your GPA is a little lacking but your leadership activities look good so far. The internship program is extremely competitive, and so if you do not get selected this year please try again next year and work on more projects in the meantime.

In addition to your standard coursework, you should also consider going above and beyond with other online learning sources, reading textbooks from outside your major, and doing side projects away from school (e.g. designing and building things at home, fixing up old vehicles, etc). All of this will also help you with the other aspects of the application process.

The technical questions asked later in the process are usually very complex and requires a broad knowledge about almost everything in the internship field to which you apply. A lot of applicants not in their senior year will find the process difficult, as their standard courses will not have covered a lot of the fundamentals yet.

BlueOrigin,"You gotta do away with the relevant courses section, not a single place cares about those, the general opinion is engineering school is engineering school, it's better used for skills, software, or project description. As a student you're resume should seriously lean on project experience, really try to communicate everything you've designed, built, and tested. Use technical terms if possible to hit more of the keywords in the job description. Being below 3.0 does seriously hurt you for the automatic gating, but it's not guaranteed rejection. Get yourself up to a 3.2 and really really focus on maximizing your project /team experience, because that's the shit that gets you internships and jobs.

Go build that rocket engine, or if that's unrealistic, scale it back to something you can build.
* Put your current student status (e.g. 2nd year, 3rd year) on there.  Sure, you say 2017-2022 graduation, but that still leaves ambiguity depending on what time of the year you might graduate.

BlueOrigin,"I hope this doesn't sound too harsh, but I'd be surprised if they give you a serious look.

A 2.8 GPA is pretty low for rockets, even if you have some solid project work like launching a rocket or competing in Formula SAE. Depending on involvement level, FSAE can be considered a .5 point bump, but even with that, you still need to maintain at least a 3.1 average.

Rockets are hard, so rocket companies look for people who do hard things well.

The good news is that you still have some time left before you graduate. If you want to work in aerospace, really focus on getting your GPA up to at least 3.1 and actually launch that rocket that you're currently working on.

BlueOrigin,"&gt; According to BO's website, New Glenn's first stage is built for 25 launches.

It will be interesting indeed, SpaceX has said that they believe the Block 5[ is capable of 100 flights](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/11/17341452/spacex-falcon-9-block-5-launch-landing-success) (with refurbishment every 10 flights) and it seems like they've had some challenges along the way for that.  I'm wary of automatically assuming that Blue will skip past these challenges by virtue of starting later.

&gt; Dunno about fairings, there's probably little money to save by reusing them.

SpaceX says their fairings [are about $6 million a set](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/07/video-elon-musks-6-million-rocket-part-lands-in-a-boat-in-the-ocean.html), at least they were before they started adding recovery hardware.

Because New Glenn isn't their end-game.  Like SpaceX, they have their sights set on a notional low-cost, high-volume space infrastructure.

Manufacturing: 

1. CNC operator - $18-35/hour. 35/hour is going to be if you can program. If you prove yourself at 18 to 25/hour as an operator, there is no reason you can't quickly jump up and earn a promotion. 
2. Assembly - 15-20/hour. Probably not something you should apply for, BUT, it will get your foot in the door and will make applying for other internal jobs easier. 
3. Quality/inspection - 18-35/hour. CMM/3D Scanning/x-ray scanning operator/programmer. Similar rates to CNC. Maybe a notch more money as the quality community with this experience is small (More demand, less supply). 
4. NDT Technician - 15-25/hour. Typically requires a license (FPI, flourescent penetrant inspection) as you deal with some chemicals, but easy to obtain. 

Testing (I am unsure how much they pay, but probably above manufacturing, and probably require at least an associates/certificate in electronics/engineering/controls):

BlueOrigin,"New Glenn numbers that are available right now are pretty sandbagged.  It's an as-yet unflown system.  They want to ensure the system works end to end.

They'll be reserving sizeable margins for their First Stage landing propellant and all the little things that impact a Launch Vehicle until it matures.

I think we'll see better performance as they figure out how to reuse their first stage and optimise the rocket.  Probably not doubling their TLI numbers or anything but I reckon we'll see 12t-14t on a more mature New Glenn vehicle.  The upper stage of NG is pretty beefy which always has an impact on high energy numbers.

BlueOrigin,"It's worth keeping in mind that on the website that Expendable payload capacity is quoted with reusable prices.

And GTO is not always the same.  Falcon 9 has sent heavier GEO sats to less demanding GTO orbits.  Whereas (for example) Arabsat on FH was sent to a more demanding GTO orbit but was lighter.

I'm not sure which GTO orbit the max payload numbers for Falcon Heavy refer to.  I'd imagine GTO-1800.

TLI numbers generally refer to a narrow band of performance.  Folks on NSF usually consider that 15t-18t to TLI on FH-Expendable is achievable.

Final consideration I'd throw in to the mix of confusion is that NASA LSP may be quoting numbers that reserve a margin for under-performance of the launch vehicle.  If the actual utter maximum performance of FH to TLI is 18t but there is an off-nominal event during launch that reduces performance then you're 18t won't get to TLI.

Having a safe margin in your payload numbers is a way to increase reliability in mission success.  All launch providers do this to varying degrees.

BlueOrigin,"My goal with this idea is to simplify construction in space by having pieces that interlock securely and don’t require perfect welding.

Since I don't have the skills to draw it well I will me more detailed in my description. Here is a link to the image.

[https://imgur.com/a/FAPBi8A](https://imgur.com/a/FAPBi8A)

On each hexagon, on the sides where they hook to other hexagonal pieces, have the edge similar to a channel, with one piece interconnecting with the other piece. Imagine them laying flat, the channel would be facing up on one piece and down on the other so the two would interconnect. Now, imagine them broken into sections, perhaps four pieces on a side, so that the channel goes up for ¼ of the side and down for the next 1/4th.  The second piece would be made so they interconnect in the same way.

The pentagonal section would possibly connect with all of the adjoining hexagonal sections in a simpler way since they are being connected from the inside, air pressure pushing them out.

My son-in-law is an airframe engineer and he suggested the joints could be sealed similarly to how airplane doors are sealed, but you would know more about how to seal seams in space. That would relieve the need to have perfect welds to seal the system.

He also suggested that welding keeps the pieces from sliding against each other so welding would be good, but it wouldn’t have to be perfect. Adequate to maintain the rigidity necessary.

On the side of the hexagons that connect with other hexagons, a system could be worked out. Since you have a finite number of sections you can stack and assemble the same way, it has various solutions. Since in what I diagramed above, there are two patterns of channel and three sides to be connected to hexagons, the pattern I made breaks down.

I have used the term channel as the connectors, but the channel can be as simple as channel steel used in construction, but other versions of the concept can be more useful. If one side is like a 1 inch rod and the receptor is contoured to receive it snugly, it would assemble more easily and provide a better seal.

Thank you for asking for more input.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/fyafuy/orb2_full_assembly_render_of_a_space_station/fn4951q/
BlueOrigin,The statistics are way lower than what your comment implies.,/r/BlueOrigin/comments/fxe6eq/rocket_report_new_shepard_push_angers_workers/fn3v6ce/
BlueOrigin,"With that arm it looks like the hardest part to design is going to be how the panels mate. you need a solid connection that can handle the strain of moving the pieces around along with  lining up power and data connections that are far more delicate and easier to accidentally break when you are pushing to large slabs of metal and the like together.  This is more true if you are putting power and data connections near where you are going to be welding. 

There is also that issue of furnishing such a large pressure vessel while in space with the volume constants of everything needing to fit through a NDA airlock. It is going to one or two dedicated launches just to get all the ventilation in so there aren't large pockets of dead air. Then furnishing it with electrical and data lines  so that the inner parts of the sphere can be filled with experiments or just lights adds more to the challenge even if slapping up webbing and fabric can do for unimportant walls.

Now I'm not saying that finding a good way to build large pressure vessels in space is bad idea mind you. It is just that the pressure vessel and shielding and a basic electrical and data structure just gives you the equivalent of a house with the exterior water tight but the interior still just 2x4s, plywood, and cinder blocks and the electrical system roughed in. Your cost per raw volume might be lower when looking at just the outside but sacrificing some volume for more work to be already done is likely going to be cheaper after you take in the costs of finishing the station. 

If your space hotel wants to have big spaces for people to play around in zero g this seems like a good option.

BlueOrigin,"I see that one of the criteria for panels mentioned in the paper is to have good symmetry of parts, but perhaps one thing to consider for a future iteration of the design is to use a fractional truncation of the isocahedron. 

If we start with triangles in the isocahedron with side length 1, a normal truncation would result in sides of the pentagons and hexagons of length 1/3. However, if the side length of the pentagons is ~0.41947, and the hexagons are squashed such that sides 1,3,5 have length ~0.41947 and sides 2,4,6 have length ~0.290265, this results in both polygons inscribing the same circle. This results in an areal efficiency of 80.89% for the hexagons (a decrease), but a significantly increased efficiency of 75.68% for the pentagons. For a defined circle radius defined by the launch vehicle, this could result in an increase in surface area of 9.3%, or a radius increase of about half that, nearly for free.

This would reduce symmetry of the hexagons from 6x to 3x, but perhaps the full symmetry isn't needed.

I was critical of the commercial spaceflight federations request for the government to supply NewSpace companies with PPE at a time when first responders and healthcare workers couldn't obtain them.

The company was originally targeting April 10 for the next New Shepard launch and was working toward that date as recently as last weekend.

&gt; *Safety is the priority* ... During a meeting on Wednesday, Jeff Ashby, a senior mission assurance director at Blue Origin and a former NASA astronaut, suggested there may be employment repercussions if workers didn't agree with management's decisions.

As a company, this seems a little disingenuous on Blue's part.

The employees are volunteering their time, which shows that Biue as a company isn't wholly committed. 

It's also inefficient.  Visors are low value uncomplicated parts, better suited to production through different methods. At best they can do 3 per hour per machine. I would be surprised if they don't have access to at least one injection molder, certainly they have the CNC equipment to produce the molds. Likely they are laser cutting the shields themselves. 

Sorry to be the cynic - again the individuals here are doing great work. As a company this seems like a pretty low effort output.

\-Blue Moon is designed for vacuum operation in 0 to 1/6thg, so it has entirely different aerodynamic, structural, and thermal requirements than NS. 

\-NS uses a combination of GPS and land based tracking for its position solution, neither of which propagate to a lunar lander.

BlueOrigin,"Actually, the oxygen-rich pre-burners and turbopumps are some of the most difficult components to get right on a rocket engine.

Hot high-pressure oxygen is crazy corrosive.  For the past few decades, American rocket scientists couldn't figure out how to build an oxygen-rich preburner / turbopump.  The Russians figured out how, which was why ULA purchased Russian RD-180 engines (which uses Oxygen-Rich Staged Combustion cycle)  for the Atlas V--  No American rocket engine used ORSC until Blue Origin came out with the BE-4 and SpaceX came out with the Raptor (which is Full-Flow Staged Combustion, using both Fuel-Rich and Oxygen-Rich staged combustion preburners and turbopumps).

When NASA was developing the Space Shuttle, to get efficiency out of the SSME they wanted to use closed-cycle staged combustion but Rocketdyne couldn't figure out how to do oxygen-rich staged combustion, so they went for fuel-rich staged combustion (FRSC) instead for the RS-25 SSME.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/fs0exo/why_methalox_engines_for_new_glenns_first_stage/fmggjd1/

In the US, most of the research for engines went into hydrolox engines, and that's pretty much all that they have built, with the exception of the RS-56 on Atlas missiles and the F-1 on the Saturn V first stage. Both were gas-generator cycle engines, which means they weren't very efficient. The research went toward hydrolox because US scientists believed that staged-combustion kerolox engines weren't possible. So we ended up with the RS-68 (on the delta) and the RS-25 (on the space shuttle). Those are pretty old, and there's been little research in engines in the US since the RS-25 was built. 

The Russians went off and built a bunch of different staged-combustion kerolox engines, proving the US scientists wrong. Those are \*great\* engines for single use boosters, and that's why ULA chose russian engines for the Atlas V. 

And the field mostly stagnated. SpaceX with with kerolox for Falcon 1 because they could base it on the NASA Fastrac engine from the 1990s, which is kerolox but not staged combustion; it's just supposed to be cheap. 

The move to methalox now is happening because a) we actually have two companies building new engines for their new vehicles, and b) both companies want to reuse them, which means kerolox is less desirable.

Does that help?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/fs0exo/why_methalox_engines_for_new_glenns_first_stage/fmd4ah1/
BlueOrigin,"A jet engine is designed to burn comparatively small amounts of kerosene at a time over a long period of time (burn time measured in hours).  A Boeing 747 for example with a full load of 185 metric tons of kerosene jet fuel is capable of flying over 8000 miles with a load of passengers and luggage.  So 185 metric tons of kerosene jet fuel burnt over a 14 hour flight.

A rocket engine on the other hand is designed to burn A LOT of rocket fuel over a very short period of time.  The Merlin 1D on a Falcon 9 for example has a burn time of 162 seconds, over which a single Merlin 1D SL engine will burn almost 15 metric tons of RP-1 in those 162 seconds.  (full RP-1 load for the Falcon 9 booster stage is 133.6 metric tons).

So a kerolox rocket booster like the Falcon 9 will burn 3/4 the fuel load of a Boeing 747 in just 162 seconds, which would otherwise last that Boeing 747 almost 10 hours.

To burn that much fuel in such a short amount of time, high-performance rocket engines need to have turbomachinery that operate at far higher speeds and pressures than a jet engine, while needing to be as compact and lightweight as possible.  That is why a rocket engine is much tougher to engineer for reliability over repeated reuses.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/fs0exo/why_methalox_engines_for_new_glenns_first_stage/fmd2wrd/

If those people are traveling from Seattle to Texas they are endangering themselves and others and are utter idiots. 

Equating ""commitment"" with the willingness to ignore local, state, and federal recommendations not to leave your home except for essential reasons and a mountain of scientific data saying that if you don't travel the disease goes away faster is bonkers. 

&gt;Where's the Verge article about the SpaceX test in Texas last night?

Right here.

&gt; And all of the other people who are still trying to maintain timelines, meet milestones, etc.?

There should be more stories about companies threatening to fire people who don't  want to risk themselves and others. There aren't. That doesn't reduce how awful and unacceptable this situation is. 

&gt;Fear is not the healthiest way to make mission decisions.

...you mean like the fear of losing your job if you don't do something that endangers your life? 

&gt;Anyway, I'm just expressing my personal opinion, and my personal experience, and as such, that I feel like Blue has treated me, and the people I know, exceptionally well through this. In my opinion, this article cherry picks to paint a broad picture that's flatly distorted.

That's great. But your experience does not negate this experience. Even if every single employee other than those from this story have been told to work from home and been given all of the tools to help make that necessary it still does not excuse threatening to fire people if they refuse to travel at a time when traveling doesn't just put you in danger, but puts in danger the people you encounter while traveling, and then your family when you return home.

I, a white male, worked at Ikea when I was 20. Within a year I was given a small raise, either $0.25 or $0.50/hr. I was taking classes full time and lived with my parents, this was a part time job to help pay for school and other expenses, so I was pretty excited to get even a small raise. 

During a break with a coworker, a late-20s/early 30s mildly overweight white woman who had been there for multiple years, I mentioned the raise and my new rate of pay. I was getting paid more than her. 

I, with my two years of ***very*** part-time retail experience, was getting paid more than she was, with her 5+ years of full-time retail experience. 

An employer doing right by one employee does not justify doing poorly by another. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm on this sub because I believe in the mission and because competition is good. Despite Musk's drive and ambition SpaceX still needs competition. I am glad Blue Origin exists to help with that competition, and I hope it continues to operate. That doesn't mean I can't objectively look at a situation and say it's unacceptable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything you have said has been either dismissive, invalidating, or questioning of the alleged behavior mentioned in the article, you've tried to rationalize it with unfounded claims of biased reporting. I do not doubt that Blue Origin has treated you well and continues to do so, but you truly need to allow yourself to be open to the possibility that not everyone is treated well.

BlueOrigin,"This isn't a hit piece, it's accurate. Comparisons to other aerospace companies' justification for continuing work are failing to pick up on the thinly veiled threats Blue senior management are flowing to employees.

As a Blue Origin employee of plenty years, I can confirm the quotes in the article reflect the current management that has been installed at Blue the last several years. As has been noted here, those who follow space reporting closely know that Grush wrote some questionably objective articles several years ago and thus view her articles with skepticism but am heartbroken to say that this article is accurate. 

Over time, those willing to contradict management have been forced out or moved on and now the top level culture is filled with yes sir types. Many leaders that represent the employees have been unceremoniously ousted.

The quotes here are the most concrete evidence of the the low moral standards of Blue's latest management further confirmed by the noteworthy fact that people inside Blue (most with tremendous pride in our collective ability to retain secret information) are finding that their only course of action is to reach to the media to combat the upper echelons. Cries of desperation under the new management that started on with the tanking of the Glassdoor review have been escalated to direct leaks of audio recordings to media members.

Please note that the lack of concrete examples here is only due to fear of retribution. Blue's operating management is powered by powerful people who have horrendous morals.

BlueOrigin,"The problem with LNG is that although it has to conform to a standard which means that ""off spec"" gas can be rejected, the standard itself is quite wide. There is about 10% variation in calorific value by volume from one end of the spec to the other. This is too wide a tolerance band for a rocket so if it could use LNG it would need to be a tightly specified strain of LPG. One way of specifying it is to say methane, but that too is still quite variable as a certain percentage of other gasses is within spec for the wholesale supply. 
Ultimately I guess they will buy methane with a specific level of purity and maximum values of contaminants ...... and this ""might"" be LNG.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/fs0exo/why_methalox_engines_for_new_glenns_first_stage/fm4o74i/

BlueOrigin," I would guess the main point is oxygen availability. turbofans have an abundance of free oxygen, so the hydrocarbons are likely to completely burn, while the oxygen in rockets isn't free. Mixture ratios that lead to peak effeciency could leave some amount of unreacted carbon. This is even more drastic for raptor that has a fuel rich(ie oxygen poor) turbo pump. BE-4's turbopump is oxygen rich so it doesn't have the same issue, so there is probably more to the explanation than this.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/fs0exo/why_methalox_engines_for_new_glenns_first_stage/fm3cs40/

BlueOrigin,"There's a concept known as ""Impulse density"" that basically scales the specific impulse of a fuel by its density. This basically takes into account the size of the tanks required for a specific propellant. See article [here](http://orbitalaspirations.blogspot.com/2011/12/impulse-density.html). 

If you look, you'll notice that kerolox has an impulse density of 21,000, methalox has an impulse density of about 19,000, and hydrolox has an impulse density of about 10,000.

So, basically kerolox and methalox need tanks that are roughly the same size, and hydrolox needs tanks that are almost twice as big. This is why hydrolox is a crappy booster fuel, and why the Saturn V used kerolox on the first stage and why Atlas V did the same. 

The downside of kerolox is that it has some long-chain hydrocarbons, and those lead to soot, which makes reusability harder. It's also unfortunate that kerosene isn't cryogenic, so you have to take special precautions so that your kerosene isn't frozen by the liquid oxygen. 

Methalox is almost as good as a kerolox in impulse density, is sootless, and the two propellants are close to the same density.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/fs0exo/why_methalox_engines_for_new_glenns_first_stage/flzesfy/

Sorry for asking this but I am the type of person that learns the subject but tends to forget it along the way.

I do have a passion in space exploration and a little about myself I have been doing astrophotography for about 10 years and have taken pictures of planets, galaxy,nebula,etc of our universe. To be working on projects to bring human life to space and discover new things around the universe is what makes me enthusiastic in pursuing into space exploration.

It feels NS has been ready to go for ages, i'm not really able to figure out what the holdup is. 2020 is still slated as the year it will happen though.    

BE-4 engines have been shipped to ULA, and they're slated to leave the ground in I think early 2021, but that depends on ULA now more than BO.   

NG is ???, we don't know. There is some hardware being made, the engines are being made, the launch pad is being made, and 2021 is a possible date but it's likely to slip later.

Unfortunately I can't get a really good baseline number to scale everything too.

This recent presentation has lots of slide decks where one can scale off the renderings. There is a little astronaut shown in some of these slide decks but it turns out that the astronaut height isn't a consistent item from slide to slide, resulting in really massive variations that don't make sense to the rest of the components and the integrated stack renderings.

A new surface rendering: https://twitter.com/SciGuySpace/status/1276193723823656967/photo/1


There was an earlier picture from Blue Origin listing the lander as capable as 14 tonnes to the lunar surface (I can dig it up and post it if requested). This corresponds VERY well to a 14 tonne wet mass of the ascent element given the ISP, deltaV requirements, and a couple basic assumptions on crew cabin mass etc. One can pretty well work backwards on all the other elements to determine their mass. I estimate the lunar lander has to mass 15 tonnes through TLI. Either New Glenn has to be capable of that or the lander is larger and takes itself through TLI from a GTO-like orbit (which I doubt is the case but one could estimate propellant mass from these renderings and tank volumes).",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hfr0sp/eric_berger_with_blue_moon_details_from_a/

BlueOrigin,"New Glenn has 9+ launches on their manifest. Satellites are generally ordered 2-4 years in advance of the expected launch, and launches are generally ordered 2+ years before the expected launch. This information is usually public: either the satellite buyer or the satellite builder is often a public company, and this is material information. Arianespace (which provides Ariane launches) is also a public company.

Now that New Glenn's initial launch is expected around the end of 2021, a brief 18 months from now, we ought to be able to see a lot of public information about the satellites that are on New Glenn's manifest. So I attempted to look it all up, and here's what I found:

3 GEO satellite launch orders

* 1 for Eutelsat
* Launch order announced March 7, 2017 -- one satellite for launch in 2021/2022, to be selected 12 months prior
* Eutelsat HOTBIRD 13F launch 2021 -- Ariane NET September 2021
* Eutelsat HOTBIRD 16G launch 2021 -- Ariane NET September 2021
* Eutelsat KONNECT VHTS launch 2022 -- Ariane64
* Eutelsat 10B ordered Oct 29, 2019 -- launch 2022 -- no known launch provider -- could be the New Glenn payload
* [No other public satellite orders](https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/sat-contracts.htm)


* 1 for mu Space Corp
* Launch order announced March 12, 2018 for launch in 2020
* Had yet to select a manufacturer at announcement
* [Article from June 16, 2019 says ""as soon as 2021""](https://www.thephuketnews.com/rising-stars-thai-start-up-mu-space-corp-to-launch-space-tourism-in-asian-first-71765.php)
* No known satellite order


* 1 for SKY Perfect JSAT
* Launch order announced March 12, 2018
* Contract does not specify what satellite will be launched
* [July 1, 2018 article says the satellite is yet to be procured](https://spacenews.com/sky-perfect-jsat-mulls-future-technology-investments/)
* [All known previously ordered satellites have launched](https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/sat-contracts.htm)

6+ LEO Constellation launch orders

* 1+ Launch for Telesat
* Launch contract signed January, 2019 for LEO satellites
* [Contract to build LEO constellation has not been awarded to date](https://spacenews.com/telesat-preparing-for-mid-2020-constellation-manufacturer-selection/)
* Telesat has no known GEO satellites on order
* LEO constellation has a deadline to have 30 satellites up by Jan 1, 2023


* 5 launches for OneWeb
* OneWeb is in bankruptcy and may or may not continue deploying their constellation
* The bankruptcy filing lists Arianespace as an unsecured creditor, and not Blue Origin

BlueOrigin,"Long story short, Boeing moved me across the country a little less than a year ago into a job that has not at all turned out to be what I thought it was and I'd really like to get out. Every single day I find myself wading through a tangled, bureaucratic cesspool of archaic processes, procedures, and specifications and its driving me insane. Somehow there are a million procedures for everything and yet no one actually knows how to do anything. Its quite mind-boggling, honestly. 

I desperately need a more modern, faster-paced, and technically-challenging work environment/job. I love aerospace but I'm beginning to realize I simply cannot handle shit loads of paper pushing and bureaucracy. I cannot handle how unbelievably niche and narrow-scoped everyone's job here seems to be.

BlueOrigin,"Hi, thanks for reading my thread.

I just watched the going to space to save Earth vid (a little late to the party) and thought it was curious that Bezos didn't delve more into how he envisions the extraction of the “limitless resources of space” will actually work. There is a moment where the screen shows a picture of the Moon and it reads “everything we need” or something to that effect however clearly we can't just keep mining the Moon indefinitely for the raw materials needed to build O'Neill Cylinders or it will become hollowed out, there's only so much Moon to mine, and the whole idea is to *not* mine the Earth in the future so I guess that leaves asteroid mining, which would truly provide near infinite quantities of raw materials, precious metals, water, etc. 

For the record as far as I know the economics of asteroid mining are still a bit hand wavey at best and would consider myself “neutral” on the concept, it seems like rather than a source of economic profit for Earth based communities likes those dumb pop-sci articles imply (“The First Trillionaires in Space!”) it would actually work more in a kind of “post scarcity” scenario for humanity like Bezos envisions, perhaps swarms of BO manufactured cheap, expendable AI powered drones mine the asteroids and the raw materials in question aren't a source of significant economic value by themselves due to the inherent near infinite supply, they are just the building blocks of things like O'Neill Cylinders. 

I dunno just kind of puzzled that he didn't go into more detail of “Gate #2” i.e. in-space manufacturing, I mean he did concede no one has any idea how it will work yet but I'm sure he has at least some theories considering the investment he is making in the concept.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/ge3dq4/blue_origin_oneill_cylinders_and_asteroid_mining/

SLS is used to send crew to high lunar orbit using Orion.       
A transfer stage, ascent stage and descent stage are sent to high lunar orbit using 3 commercial rockets or 1 SLS. Then they rendezvous together. Crew moves to this from Orion. 

Transfer stage takes ascent and descent to low lunar. Transfer stage goes back to high lunar. Can be reused next time if fuel supplies arrive.     

Descent and ascent stage lands on moon. Astronauts do blah blah blah.

Ascent stage takes crew back to high lunar. Ascent stage can be reused for next mission if fuel supplies arrive.   

Crew transfers to orion, go back to blue origin (earth).    
For next trip to moon:
Crew goes from earth to high lunar in using SLS/Orion.

New descent stage + fuel supplies (for ascent and transfer) sent to high lunar.

1. In near term they should push on making NS and NG commercially successful.

2. Crewed NG.

3. Upper stage outfitting and powerful rockets with big payload fairings to allow launching of space station modules (utilizing the space available in the payload bay + the upper stage is more effective than launching just station modules). Eventually, after ISS is retired, they could build orbital station and lease it to governments and private entities, and use it for their own research.

3. They have to be heavily invested in the lunar program. The moon is the springboard for Bezos' vision. Metals and fuels to mine, low g and no atm to allow for easy and cheap launches - mass drivers and space elevators will also work. It is perfect if you want orbital mega structures. I hope that the Chinese will push forward with the moon too, just to be sure that the space race won't be cancelled again. Bezos can't do this alone without the government, because it is a capital intensive effort with very vague prospects of monetary return. Bezos won't just throw his money down the drain.

A little bit about me: currently a first-year PhD student in materials science and engineering with a focus in metallurgy of additively manufactured (AM) high-temperature shape memory alloys in a top 15 engineering school. Prior to my PhD, I did two materials processes and characterization internships at NASA Langley Research Center (total of 1 year), initially working with carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs), and then AM Titanium alloy. I have BS and MS degrees in mechanical engineering, and have graduate research assistant (GRA) and graduate teaching assistant (GTA) experiences as well. Lastly, I have been involved with a few journal and conference publications (2nd author).

I am passionate in the aerospace materials (metallurgy) field, and space exploration in general. It's impossible for me to count the number of times I've contacted Blue's recruiters on LinkedIn.

BlueOrigin,"Hi Everyone!

I hope it's ok to post more questions here unless there is another thread.

As my title summarizes, a recruiter reached out to me for some positions at BO that are not exactly in my area, however he likes my skill set and we will be working accordingly. He wants to aim at a more general resume for now as we narrow down openings. I have about 4 years of industry experience at some major aerospace companies, and as my ID implies, I did my master's degree in hybrid rocket performance. Just getting a shot at applying is a dream come true! After reading some posts here, I just had a few questions:

1) For my experience level (\~4 years) would 3 pages be too much? My resume is a 2 pager but I was told to expand details, especially on a recent aircraft program that went public that I was on a flight sciences team for. 

2)  Any particular software packages and languages to focus on?  Is Matlab well accepted at BO or shunned due to being tied off a lot by Mathworks? (Seems to always have a camp of dedicated and hater engineers in every R&amp;D group I've been in). 

3) Would stressing NPSS be worth it? This is used for aircraft engines but it was originally aimed at rocketry I believe. 

4) Anything in particular to avoid? 

&amp;#x200B;

BlueOrigin,"For Blue Origin's ""National Team"" for Artemis and the Human Landing System consists of 3 parts: the Lander, Ascent vehicle, and then the Transfer Stage. The latter at first looks to be pretty boring - it's just a tug that takes the two parts from Gateway to Low Lunar Orbit where it is unceremoniously discarded.

What we know of it so far is quite sparse. It will be built by Northrop Grumman, be a derivative of Cygnus (likely the same sattelite bus they use), and be [powered by Blue Origin's BE-7.](https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/10/22/bezos-says-space-industry-stalwarts-will-help-blue-origin-build-moon-lander/)

But thinking on it more I am actually pretty excited about this lil transfer stage. Because it should be a very capable and versatile space tug that can open up a lot of possibilities.

First in order to meet the requirements of the lander it must be capable of holding its hydrolox propellant for over a long duration (at least compared to traditional upper stages). Second it must be capable of autonomous docking.  Finally it is quite likely that this transfer stage would provide all in orbit maneuvering from departing Gateway to orienting the stack in LLO before separation. 

We can take some pretty educated guesses on the total mass of his lander from [NASA's conceptual outline of the 3 stage HLS and the deltaV each stage would provide.](https://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/charts-diagrams/2019/20190404_3-stage-lander-concept.png)  So we see a 12 to 15 tonne stage performing 850 m/s dV* on a total payload of 24-28 tonnes. 

In terms of engines the [BE-7 at 40kN of thrust](https://www.blueorigin.com/engines/be-7) is about 1/3 the size of the RL-10s 110kN, and about double the Orion service module's 26.6kN AJ10. Something to keep in mind.

Knowing that the transfer stage is hydrolox and should have high ISP with BE-7 (guesstimated at 450s), a 4 tonne dry mass stage could take a 28 tonne payload from gateway to LLO using only 7 tonnes of propellant (0.85 km/s dV).  At a glance that looks like quite a bit of extra margin, but around 1.5 tonnes of extra propellant would be needed up front for the transfer stage to get from TLI to Gateway*.

**So what else could this transfer stage do?**

The first thing that comes to mind is that half serious proposal last year to use two commercial launchers to perform EM-1 with Orion instead of SLS. One of the missing pieces was the ability to dock ICPS to Orion. A stretched version of this transfer stage should have no problems there and be able to take Orion from an earth orbit out to TLI. Alternatively the long duration elements of this transfer stage could replace the Orion's primary propulsion and might just be light enough to launch to LEO on New Glenn (I think its close as a quick check). 

Second would be general tug duties. In the near term it could take larger payloads to Gateway or Low Lunar Orbit. While overkill, it could be used to deliver habitation modules that lack their own propulsion system that would otherwise need to be co manifested with Orion on SLS. By staging somewhere before TLI the tug should be able to deliver even larger modules than would be possible with a 2 stage New Glenn.

Long term with refueling it could be used to shuttle all sorts of things around cis-lunar space.

Then there are duties as integrated deep space probe propulsion buses, sort of like what Rocketlab proposes with Photon.   

TLDR I think that transfer stage could evolve to serve a lot of different tasks and it deserves a little more attention regarding its role as a piece of infrastructure in cis-lunar space.

I'm seeking any advice anyone has for this role in particular, there seem to be plenty of posts for engineering positions. I'm not sure what types of questions to anticipate for the technical screening or what type of personality Blue is looking for.

BlueOrigin,"I am flying to Kent in a few weeks to interview for a New Grad Rotation Engineer position, and I was wondering if anyone on this sub had any experience or tips with their interviews. -specifically technical material that I should focus on studying/learning before my interview. 

For context, my experience/focus is on propulsion/fluids/testing. (BS in mechanical engineering)

I want this job more than anything and I just want to be prepared as possible. I know how competitive this position is and I want to put absolutely everything I have into this.  I just don't really know where to begin with preparing other than basic behavioral questions.

BlueOrigin,"Okay, simple question.

BO says the extended version of the lunar lander (which will also be used for crewed landings) can transport 20 tons to the lunar surface.

BO lists the payload to GEO (less energy then TLI) as 13 tons.

So there are three possibilities.

* They will use expendable launches which have no listed payload capacity
* They will use orbital refueling
* They have a third stage??? Was their third stage canceled or could it increase the performance that much?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/eav6lj/is_bo_working_on_orbital_refueling/
BlueOrigin,"Sorry if I’m asking a noob question. As far as I know, going with oxidizer-rich environment is more corrosive for preburner and turbomachinery than a fuel-rich environment. It will also requires expensive super-alloys that can withstand these corrosive environments for multiple reuse. Going with fuel-rich preburner would be less problematic and less expensive. So, what advantages does an oxidizer-rich environment offer over a fuel-rich one that engineers at Blue Origin went with a more difficult engine cycle? What compromises did they make?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/eagaj1/why_did_be4_engine_go_with_an_oxidizerrich/

BlueOrigin,"Blue Origin doubters often like to point to the companies ""lack of progress"" as a sign that the company has been resting on its laurels. This couldn't be further from the truth.

Let's see what Blue Origin has been cooking up the past few years.

* Have built and launched a sub-orbital rocket. Becoming the first people to successfully  land a rocket from space, using rocket engines. Have launched 100 science payloads to space aiding in scientific research.

* They built and are currently developing the BE-4 engine. A very important rocket engine as it will power two future rockets to space.

* They are refurbishing LC36 and upgrading it to launch New Glenn.

* They have built a rocket factory near LC36 which will manufacture and refurbish New Glenn.

* They are currently constructing their rocket engine factory in Alabama. Which will make BE4's.

* They are currently building the New Glenn rocket. Set to launch in 2021.

* They are three years into development of Blue Moon lander, with over seventeen minutes of firing time for the new BE-7 engines.

So on the surface it may appear they are just burning through cash with nothing to show for it, in fact they are not. A lot of the money is used on New Glenn and a lot on infrastructure.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/e920tx/theyve_got_a_ton_of_money_and_theyre_not_doing_a/

BlueOrigin,"I have been applying to Blue Origin nonstop for about the last 6 months since I will be graduating soon. I have had interviews with other space industry companies, but Blue has been my white whale. Of all of the space companies out there Blue has the road map I believe in the most, so I know that it is my goal because I will be best able to give back. At this point, I just want to know if I should be doing something different, so I can keep grinding to do what I can to land an interview.

Info about myself:

I am a current PhD student who will be graduating in May whose dissertation work is next generation structural composite materials development under NASA funding. I have a pretty heavy R&amp;D background and have been specializing in polymer matrix composites for about 8.5 years now.

BlueOrigin," I am curious about the general salary range and other benefits. I was afraid of asking these to the recruiter before getting into onsite interview.

For Engineers level 3 what is the salary band? I’ve looked at the Glassdoor and it seems around 110K\~130k? Can it be more? Generally, what is the raise % after 1 year?

Another question is, what is the 401k match %? I also saw in Glassdoor that it is 3%, which seems very low compared to other companies. I also heard that some stocks are given (although BO is not public so can’t liquidate these stocks.) It seems like general opinion is that these stocks are worthless until maybe after 10\~20 years from now that BO maybe do IPO and listed on the stock market.

What other general perks does it provide? I heard that pets are allowed in the office. What about free coffee, free food? What about PTOs? Can I wear t-shirts and jeans to office? Any free EV car charging? Commuter benfits like subsidizing vanpool, shower facility for bicycle riders, etc?

Any info will be greatly appreciated. 

Plus, if you rather share via PM, I can also share via PM about compensation info for Boeing.

By the way, Boeing does not provide free food at all. No free coffee either. The cafeteria is served by Eurest and its food cost is around 8bucks minimum and the quality is subpar.

Boeing has good commuter benfits, pays out vanpool or bus card upto 60bucks. Most building has very good shower/locker for bike commuters.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/dpft1j/what_are_blue_origin_salary_and_other_perks/

BlueOrigin,"I posted this on the Spacexlounge subreddit, but I would like to know Blue Origin's fan perspective on this issue.

As many space fans know, SpaceX is hard at work on their new revolutionary Starship. A fully reusable spaceship that will take humans to the moon and back. The first prototypes are already being built at a breakneck speed using their revolutionary construction method that has cut down on cost and complexity.

Starship will launch to orbit by the end of next year and shortly thereafter carry crew, according to SpaceX. Elon Musk has said the cost will be less than a Falcon 9 rocket, perhaps ten million per launch. It can land, get refueled and launch again, with out refurbishment, just like an aircraft. This means that spaceX will offer cheap, safe access to space.

Now the problem for Blue Origin is that their rocket is only partially reusable. Even if it's cheaper than a Falcon 9 (though it will be more expensive because it will have to recoup development costs), they won't be able to offer competitive prices, compared to what Starship will offer. This is problem for long term growth of the company. How will they get payloads when Starship undercuts them on price?

The question then is, how will blue origin compete with Starship? Perhaps the upper stage of the New Glenn could be converted into a reusable ship, but at this stage they don't have much experience even flying to orbit let alone designing and building such a complex spacecraft. They need an answer, but I'm not sure what it will be.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/djy32v/can_blue_origin_compete_with_starship/

Credit to NASASpaceFlight Forums's member Su27k for finding the link.

Summary of relevant section:  After consultation with Blue Origin, NASA says the smaller LUVOIR-B version can be launched on New Glenn.

The report also states that New Glenn will be undergoing a Critical Design Review around this time of 2019, and the factory in Cape Canaveral is being completed and will be populated with tooling late this year.

Sounds like Blue Origin will start to bend metal on its first New Glenn flight article once 1) the design passes the CDR, 2) the BE-4 completes flight qualification testing, and 3) the factory construction is complete and the tooling installed.  So figure beginning of 2020 for construction of the first finalized-design New Glenn to start in earnest.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/cyszqr/nasas_luvoir_final_report_released_82619_mentions/
BlueOrigin,"Hey everyone, 

Blue just posted their internship application for next summer and I have a (stupid) question. There is a section that simply states ""Write a 250-word (or less) statement on your passion:""

For those who have had success applying in the past, is this section where I should explain my passion for the space industry? Or is it more of a writing sample and I can explain any passion (space related or not)? Just curious, because I'm sure nearly every response is related to a passion for space and they probably end up being pretty boring/repetitive for the reviewer. So, I'm wondering if it is appropriate to branch out.

So I've steadily watched Blue Origin's Glassdoor rating *plummet* (see the graph) over the past couple years. This is an especially good forum for you current and former employees, contractors, etc. to chime in. 

*Is it worth wanting to or going to work for this company in a couple years if this is the current employment outlook?*

I've heard, read, and seen several things on Glassdoor and in other places...

* Meaningless stock options
* ""Yes men"" culture
* Bad technical management
* Aggressive middle managers
* ""Back-stabby coworkers""
* Low pay
   * Seattle is becoming more expensive to live in
* Bad working environment: (Shrinking desk sizes, gimmicky open office floor plan)
* Kent isn't a nice place to live

BlueOrigin,"The 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing has caused me to ask a question: what testing will Blue Origin do of the Blue Moon hardware?

Back in the 1960s, NASA created the [Lunar Landing Research Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Landing_Research_Vehicle) to study how they were going to land a vehicle on the Moon. The vehicle consisted of a jet engine pointed downwards, generating enough thrust to simulate the Moon's one-sixth gravity, and other rockets to provide fine control. (This is a similar concept to the earlier Rolls Royce's [Flying Bedstead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Thrust_Measuring_Rig), which led to the Short SC1 and the Harrier Jump Jet).

More recently, NASA have invested in  [Project Morpheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Morpheus), a methalox VTL lunar lander test rig. Masten Aerospace are developing testbeds such as the [XL-1T](https://www.masten.aero/xl1t) to test lunar landing technologies.

So, what are the odds that Blue Origin produce some form of crewed or uncrewed lander, perhaps using a BE-8 as well as a jet engine, to test their systems here on Earth?  They have a certain track record with vertical jets, with their initial Charon VTL system.

Whilst modern computer systems allow simulations that reduce the need for as much hardware testing, it seems likely to me that we'll see some sort of system being tested within the next year. It's costly, but it should reduce mission risk.

Or will they just manage without such a system?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/ch44mw/blue_moon_hardware_testing/

BlueOrigin," I still have software to develop, but hardware is fairly mature. 

Battery pack is custom, such that I can distribute the weight more freely. Both circumference-ily and in the Z axis.

Control is taken care of by 2 perpendicular servos and control surfaces. 

Orientation comes from a gyro and accelerometer. 

Software sits (will sit) inside a microcontroller.

Thrust comes from two opposite rotating propellers.

Communications is with Bluetooth. I also have another transceiver, not sure of the band it uses.

BlueOrigin,"So Bezos talks a big game about building space infrastructure for future generations but it seems that there is no real clarity on what he actually intends to do. Right now, the talk is only about rockets. But that's the easy (relatively) part. What's the plan after that? Will BO only be a very affordable launch provider? Will they fund a moon/mars base etc? 

SpaceX and Musk are very clear in that they want to go to Mars and build a base there. Its a specific actionable plan. Bezos' idea is to move industries to space while we turn earth into giant nature park / residential zone. Its too vague. I imagine that a lot of research and re-work would need to be done for industrial processes that work on earth to work in space. That's stuff that the industry leaders and experts would need to do themselves. Bezos can't do it for them. Maybe he sets up a r&amp;d office to work on tech to build o'neil cylinders?

BlueOrigin,"I have no doubt that we can build viable O'Neill Cylinders - at some point.  It is ""just"" an engineering problem and we are very clever when it comes to technological solutions.  So far in our discussions, this subreddit seems entirely focused on the construction/technology of Cylinders.  That seems like the easy part.

My concerns are more about what life in such a environment would be like.

In particular, the Cylinder appears very fragile to hull damage.  A relatively small breech (compared to the entire hull area) leads to significant loss of atmosphere unless repaired quickly.  The centrifugal force will actively and rapidly vent the air.

Consider a resident hostile force intentionally set on destroying life in the Cylinder.  Perhaps they threaten destruction unless paid a ransom, perhaps they are politically motivated.  Using today's words we would term it a ""terrorist"" organization.  It seems that their mission would easily succeed with little effort.  It wouldn't take much tech to catastrophically damage the hull.  They would probably strike in multiple, far separated locations.  Certainly they would die as well, as self-proclaimed ""martyrs"", undoubtedly.

How could we guard against this occurrence?

Of necessity, I think the government would likely engage in extensive surveillance of the populace.  It seems likely they would take a heavy authoritarian, militaristic approach.  I'm postulating a paranoid streak in the government due to the perceived danger.  The government would be constantly suspicious of their citizens.  I think there would not be much personal freedom, consequently.  (Hello, big brother.)

But a hostile force wouldn't even need access to the interior.  They could stand off at a distance with a mass driver and take out the Cylinder.

That factor leads to the necessity of an external mobile security force for the Cylinder, quite robust.  I'm not sure how even that force would protect against incoming masses at high velocities.  As usual, government support of such a defense team drains more productive activity.

Given these dangers, I'm not sure putting millions of people at risk is a such a good idea.  While I really like the *idea* of O'Neill space colonies, I think they have serious problems due to human behavior issues.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/c8x2g5/the_future_in_oneil_cylinders/

BlueOrigin,"I've been thinking about how Blue Origin will test the New Glenn to qualify it as Operational.

While it could be deployed like the Saturn V, I think this unlikely.  As a quick review, the Saturn V program used an ""all up"" scenario.  Each of the parts, including the complete stages, were ground tested completely.  Finally, the whole rocket was integrated and flown.  The point being that the first time any parts of the rocket flew, it was as a whole Saturn V.

In my opinion, it seems implausible that BO will use this technique for the NG.  The primary motivation for ""all up"" testing of the Saturn V was expediency.  (After all, it was a real space race.)  BO seems to believe in intentional slow development.  ""All up"" testing seems counter to the ""step by step"" and ""slow and steady wins the game"" Blue Origin philosophy.

Thus, I have a hard time imagining that Blue Origin would build a complete New Glenn and launch it for recovery on their ship as the first flight in ""all up"" fashion.  

I think it much more likely that we would see ""hopper"" tests with a reduced first stage, followed by hopper tests with gradually more elaborate first stages, leading to a test of a ""production"" first stage.  Likewise, landing on the actual recovery vessel will occur only in the latter first stage tests.  Why risk an expensive vessel until you have  greater confidence in the test article?  Instead, we will see land-based recovery early in the testing.


Since the second/third stages use vacuum-optimized engines, I don't see a good method of testing them except in flight atop a first stage.  Perhaps some aerospace engineer can elucidate?

In any event, we should have significant, unambiguous, public notice when Blue Origin commences testing.  You can't launch without FAA clearance, after all.  There aren't any secrets, there.

I also speculate (without any real data) that Blue Origin is looking at a year or more of testing prior to a complete flight profile (recovery included).  This is Blue Origin, after all.

So in order to hit a ""2021 New Glenn is operational"" milestone, we should see testing start by the beginning of 2020.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/bt8ins/speculation_on_new_glenn_testing_program_aka_how/

* [Geekwire.com Article](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/blue-origin-tweets-picture-antarctic-expedition-hinting-moon-mission/)
 
* [CNET.com Article](https://www.cnet.com/news/blue-origin-cryptic-tweet-hints-at-a-new-adventure/)

* You get the idea....

**So Now It's Your Turn!**

* What do you think the announcement will be?

* Is it something moon related? Or south-pole related?

* Who knows!  That's what makes this fun!

**This post will be updated as new information is released.  Don't expect anything until May 9th, however.**

BlueOrigin,"   Let's face it, Old Space concepts/ mission architectures are (within the next few decades at least) going to become very outdated at the rate that SpaceX is progressing with Starship/Superheavy. With that being said Blue Origins mission design for sending humans to the moon should not resemble Apollo but rather should resemble starship instead. Even if some performance is lost with having to carry a side mounted heatsheild around the sheer quantity of performance you get from a Starship style upper stage with orbital refueling is enough to justify the incured performance loss, 

   Overall the Space industry needs to transition from designing missions to land a few astronauts on the moon- mars to launching dozens of people at a time. This is why I think BO should design a integrated upper stage vehicle for New Glenn. For tourist flights the cost incurred by throwing away the upper stage after every flight is too much to be competitive. This is why I think New Glenn should have a Starship style upper stage rather than a traditional upper stage.

p.s - having what is essentially a hydro lox version of Starship would give BO a tremendous advantage over SpaceX in Lunar Operations because BO could take advantage of Lunar ISRU while SpaceX couldn't since there is little to no carbon on the moon.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/biv32n/unpopular_opinion_bo_should_build_an_integrated/

BlueOrigin,"   Earlier today I was thinking about something relating to New Glenn. We know for a fact that After Blue is satisfied with their tourists flights on New Shepherd they are planning on starting manned orbital flights on a New Glenn capsule. While the margin exists for New Glenn to send such a capsule into LEO with just 45 tonnes to LEO it wouldn't have the power to send the Capsule on Trans Lunar Injection. With that being said is there any way that New Glenn could be uprated in terms of thrust and payload capacity to launch manned lunar missions or will we have to wait for New Armstrong? (mid-2030's)

BlueOrigin,"Blue Origin produced the New Shepard rocket with minimal mishaps. The second iteration of New Shepard, NS2, became the first booster rocket to perform a vertical landing after returning to space. The rocket flew to space a total of *five times*. NS2 was not expected to survive its fifth and final flight, as the mission included a high velocity separation of the passenger capsule which was outside of its design parameters. The rocket, however, was never made aware of this fact and landed itself perfectly anyway. 

NS2 now decorates the lobby of the Blue Origin factory in Cape Canaveral as a testament to the tenacity of a booster that was developed with reuse in mind from the start, and for which every precaution was taken to make it reliable for multiple reuses. New Shepard is poised to become the first private rocket to take humans into space. 

This same approach is being used in the design and production of the next Blue Origin rocket, the much larger New Glenn. Having demonstrated reusability with NS and learned many lessons in doing so, the New Glenn will likewise be designed for reuse from its very first flight. The rocket's design is deliberate, as is its mission, and reuse will not be added as an afterthought. 

The main engine of the New Glenn, the BE-4, has already impressed the industry, and inspired so much confidence that it will also be used as the main engine of the ULA Atlas V rocket. BE-4 is also looking to become one of the first, if not the first, ever LOX/methane-fueled engine to bring a rocket into space.

Blue Origin has also made huge strides towards the production and facilitation of the New Glenn rocket, as is made evident by the enormous Blue Origin factory constructed at Cape Canaveral, and to which another huge expansion is already being made. Blue Origin has leased Launch Complex 36 to facilitate launches of New Glenn, and construction around the site is literally transforming the landscape. And as if that weren't enough, Blue Origin is also in the process of refitting a massive freighter ship into an even more massive landing pad for New Glenn - because, again, New Glenn has been designed with reuse in mind from the very start.

When New Glenn launches, it will be faraway the largest, most ambitious rocket in the world, and it has already secured contracts for launches with both private companies as well as government. So while some may tell you that Blue Origin is getting 
nowhere simply due to a persistent social media presence, I would like this thread to remind people that Blue Origin has done great work and will likely keep doing great work - because we have been given no reason to doubt them yet.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/bbabzi/the_really_unpopular_opinion_gradatium_ferociter/

BlueOrigin,"   Let's face it, with all the innovations they have been able to make in such a relatively short period of time. SpaceX is quickly becoming what most people talk about when they refer to the apex of the aerospace/launch industry. The main thing that has driven SpaceX's innovation is the sense of urgency and the aggressive timelines that are placed on the employees while stressful yields some impressive results that are not only amazing in technical terms but also fairly cost effective. Robert Zubrin always says that SpaceX was able to do what NASA is doing with SLS for ""1/3 the time at 1/10th the cost.""

While there are definitely clear benefits to not rushing and rapidly iterating to the point where no two vehicles are the same. The amount of dilly-dallying that Blue Origin is doing given the resources that they have is at this point (IMO) unsustainable and just not going to work. For innovation to occur teams working for any company need to have a sense of urgency to fulfill their timelines, and with BO I am afraid that the lack of that is putting strain on the companies ability to deliver, I mean look at it like this.

SpaceX was founded a whole two years after Blue Origin and within 6 years they had their first orbital vehicle flying (Falcon 1).
It took Blue Origin a full 15 years to just fly a suborbital vehicle. And four years later they are still stuck in test-flight limbo despite not having a single RUD after 10 test flights. While I was hoping the incrementalism would pay off for New Glenn I sadly don't think this is going to be the case. BO is already begging the Airforce to postpone their second round EELV contracts because they don't think New Glenn will be ready by then (2024). IMO their sluggish pace is starting to catch up with them and not in a good sense. Bezos likes to talk about how results are more important than timelines or petty ""races"" which I somewhat agree with, but what I think he fails to realize as that those kinds of results don't happen without a sense of urgency. At this point at their current pace It pains me to say this but I can't see New Glenn flying until 2024, I can't see them flying humans into LEO until 2030 (which by that time SpaceX probably will have landed humans on mars) And we might have to wait until 2040 for New Armstrong which would be embarrassing considering SpaceX probably will have been flying Starship for upwards of 18 year by then, birth to legal adulthood. 

While I am a SpaceX fan (you can probably tell by my username) I really love Blue Origin as well and I want them to succeed almost as badly as I want SpaceX to be successful. If Musk is inspired by ""The Case for Mars"" then Bezos and BO are inspired by ""The High Frontier"" I see both martian colonization as well as a robust cis-lunar infrastructure and economy as complementary as well as mutually beneficial to one another which is why I want both to succeed. However I just don't see that happening with their current business philosophy, which Is why I think it needs to change if BO is to accomplish their long term goal of millions living and working in space in the first place.

P.S - I know this kind of thing may come off a controversial but please don't down-vote simply becasue you disagree with my opinion. Instead please give me some substance as to why you disagree in the form of a comment, Thank you.

Also - While the timeline is agonizingly slow I applaud BO for making their first orbital rocket borderline Super Heavy. Since that will likely make scaling up to New Armstrong much easier.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/bb36lq/unpopular_opinion_gradatium_ferociter_is_not/

BlueOrigin,"&gt;**Reusing rocket upper stages**. Blue Origin is [considering](https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-studying-repurposing-of-new-glenn-upper-stages/) repurposing the upper stages of their upcoming New Glenn rocket for use in orbit, possibly as habitats. (Development of [New Glenn](https://www.blueorigin.com/new-glenn/) remains on schedule for launch in 2021.) A group consisting of NanoRacks, SSL, and ULA has also [studied repurposing orbital rocket bodies](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/nasa-funds-partnership-to-explore-making-space-habitats-out-of-used-rocket-fuel-tanks) as part of NASA's [NextSTEP](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nextstep-partnerships-develop-ground-prototypes) program. That proposal would involve an Atlas 5 upper stage refitted with life support and attached to the ISS or another station. Repurposing of upper stages in orbit makes sense when considering the energies involved with returning them to the ground for reuse. An upper stage may be moving at up to 8 km/s, compared to \~2 km/s for returning first stage boosters. Decelerating for reentry at those speeds requires a large amount of fuel, heat shielding, or both. The Space Shuttle and SpaceX's proposed Starship are examples of upper stages that return to Earth for reuse using heat shields (or hypothetically “[transpirational cooling](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starship-bleeding-transpirational-atmospheric-reentry-system-challenges-2019-2)” in the case of Starship).

BlueOrigin,"   Some Blue Origin employees visited our school recently and I struck up a conversation with one of their representatives about their long term plans for human spaceflight.
   She didn't go into too much detail (as per company policy) but she did drop some interesting details to me personally. She made it very clear to me that Blue Origin believes vehemently in heavily researching and developing technologies before implementing them, and when researching technologies and architectures their main priority is how much something can be scaled.
   
   After prefacing her statement with that, she then added something very interesting, though I'm paraphrasing this is essentially what she had said to me ""Crew Capsules, parachute landing, pusher abort. Those things are just as scale able as Propulsive landing of the Booster stage on New Glenn"". 

   I took that to mean that something like the crew capsule and abort system on New Shepherd will likely be scaled up to 7 meters in diameter to match New Glenn to carry people (10-15) into orbit and potentially this could even be scaled up to New Armstrong which (assuming 12-15 meter diameter) would allow for something like 30-50 people to go into orbit, making the prospect of having millions of people living and working in space not too far fetched.

   Despite what this representative told me, I remember hearing somewhere that the capsule design doesn't scale very well past a certain diameter (~5m or so) Is there any truth to that and If so why does Blue see this as the best option for manned spaceflight going into the future at larger scales?

BlueOrigin,"   I can't stop thinking about how much of an impact Jeff Bezos and his company will have on our future as a space faring civilization. While we might still be in the barnstorming phase of commercial spaceflight now with New Shepherd's suborbital flights and development on their first orbital heavy class launcher New Glenn. The simple difference in scale between New Shepherd and New Glenn leaves no doubt in my mind that whatever comes after New Glenn (New Armstrong and others perhaps) will be on an equivalently grander scale.

  I started thinking about how Blue Origin could build the ultimate Cis-lunar transportation network and I think I was able to boil it down to a few main modular components. With just six main components Blue Origin could kick start a vast Cis-lunar infrastructure that would allow for Bezos's large scale entrepreneurship in space as well as things like in space manufacturing, mining and construction. All these things will eventually be needed for the millions living and working in space followed by their trillion+ descendants.

   *Component 1 ; The Rocket booster*

The first component would be a first stage booster, similar but not totally like the one on New Glenn. Aside from being powered by liquid methane and liquid oxygen all other similarities to new Glenn would be purely aesthetic in nature. This booster would be far bigger than New Glenn's probably between 12-15 meters in core diameter and possibly larger at the base to accommodate more engine bells. I expect it to be powered by a next generation methane powered engine (perhaps Be-5). I expect that this booster will be prohibitively large to allow for barge landings out in the ocean. Because of it's size I expect this booster to instead preform a boost-back burn and return to the launch site so that money is saved and turnaround times are quickened.

*Component 2 ; The reusable orbit shuttle*

Launched atop the booster I imagine a vehicle very similar to SpaceX's BFR in most respects, however, this is not an interplanetary spaceship but rather a reusable shuttle designed to launch up to 200 tonnes of payload as well as dozens of crew and passengers into a low earth orbit. How it will re-enter and be reused is anyone's guess, but I tend to think of a vehicle that is 12-15 meters wide/ Cylindrical with a side mounted heat shield and aero control surfaces for re-entry as well as propulsive landing ""because it scaled very well -Jeff Bezos"". For commonality with refueling and space based infrastructure I expect this vehicle to be hydrogen powered, although there is a 30% payload sacrifice. The orbit shuttle now has commonality in refueling and manufacturing with other components in this Cis-lunarr transportation system.

   *Component 3 ; The space tug*

   This hydrogen powered stage is built on earth but launched into LEO by the Orbit shuttle. It is completely space proofed with ample amounts of insulation as well as simplified engine plumbing to allow for less maintenance and less wear and tear on the engines. Weather it's taking a satellite from LEO to GEO or picking up crew and cargo from LEO to take to a Low lunar orbit. This jumbo sized hydrogen powered space tug can do it.

   *Component 4 ; Lunar Ascent/Descent tug*

Very much similar to the Space tug with a lower fuel capacity and a shorter overall length along with modified avionics and landing struts. This vehicle picks up cargo/Crew modules from the Space Tug and takes them down to the lunar surface to be offloaded by crane and have new things stacked on to be taken and linked up with a space tug in lunar orbit.

    *Component 5 ; the fuel tank*

This fuel tank module would allow for rocket fuel to be transported around Cis-lunar space since it would hook up to the front of the tug stage and could be docked with other tanks to assemble fuel depots in LEO, EML-1,2,4,5, or even in LLO. Tanks would be fairly simple autogeneously pressurized Hydrolox tanks with heavy insulation to prevent boil off as well as power hookups for refrigeration and pressure regulation.

   *Component 6 ; Crew Cargo module*

Cylindrical modules that could be launched attached to the front of a tug stage and subsequently to a lunar descent stage, capable of carrying either cargo or crew.

BlueOrigin,"   Gateway foundation website; https://gatewayspaceport.com/the-gateway/

   Many of you have probably heard of the gateway foundation. A retired cargo 747 pilot by the name of John Blincow. He started the gateway foundation about 5 years ago with the express hope of building rotating space station/ spaceports in LEO, to provide humanity with it's first serious pieces of space infrastructure. The only problem here is funding. The gateway foundation in my mind has good intentions but their funding scheme is suspiciously reminiscent of Mars One. It's essentially a private lottery in where people pay for a shot at an all expense paid trip to the station/ Spaceport, though there is vast evidence to suggest that they are legitimate (Having engineers/ aerospace professionals employed by their non-profit as well as talks with SpaceX/ Thales Alenia... ect) I don't believe the private lottery idea will work for the amount of funding that they need. Which is why I think blue origin would be a really good sponsor for them. Blue Origin wants to send tourists into LEO aboard New Glenn, but where do they expect to have those tourists stay once they're are up there? Blue Origin could use wings specializing in Space Station design and orbital construction and manufacturing. After all space tourism and orbital manufacturing are the main long term goals for BO and Bezos as a whole, why not put them under the wing of blue and provide them with some financing?

BlueOrigin,"How does the world respond to an operational New Shepard? I personally believe that space tourism even of a limited suborbital kind is going to completely change how we think about what is possible in space. Particularly I think it is going to show the industry that you can make money off of human space flight and open the floodgates to VC money and investor interest in things like space hotels, orbital transport, and space advertising.

My only evidence for why I think this is so is that we have seen this before. I remember going to conferences back in 2012/2013 where seasoned industry veterans and space cadets alike thought that commercial satellite launch was a nonstarter and that something like SpaceX was an anomaly caused by a particularly passionate billionaire. Fast forward to today and there is a ton of VC money being thrown at launch startups like Relativity, Firefly, and Vector. I think this is in part due to the fact that the success of SpaceX as a commercial launch company showed to the world that this is an industry you can be successful in and lowered the financial risk in many people’s minds.

I totally understand that the small launcher boom is also fueled by the rise of small satellites and mega constellations. I would also add that in this domain a lot of heavy lifting had to be done by early entrants like Planet Labs and Skybox to convince the world that there was money to be made.

Do you think that Blue Origin (and virgin galactic’s) decades of investment in space tourism will cause a similar paradigm shift? Will this make it easier for companies like NanoRacks, Axiom, Space Adventures and Bigelow to find the funding they need to execute on their business plans?

BlueOrigin,"   Blue Origin has now been testing New Shepherd for almost 4 years, they have now had 10 successful test flights, with the booster ever being able to land during the in-flight abort test. So far things have been progressing well and they now have a class of new shepherd that is fully capable of flying humans, yet Jeff Foust recently tweeted that the current goal at BO for flying humans in by the end of this year (meaning 2019). My question is what more does BO have to do before flying paying customers on New Shepherd, perhaps 2 more flights? 1) an uncrewed dress rehersal of the crewed flight operations and profile (NS-11, NET May 2019). Then perhaps a test flight with trained test pilots. (NS-12, NET August 2019), then perhaps NS-13 would be the first flight with paying customers, possibly NET November 2019?

BlueOrigin,"   I've lately been caught up in thinking about what the long term goals of Blue Origin are and how they might facilitate and achieve these goals. In comparison to SpaceX I see them as having a more linear development path whereas I see Blue Origin going for an exponential development path (similar to amazon, Bezos; ""While our competitors are looking 3-5 years ahead we are looking 7 years ahead"") In where things move slow in the beginning but eventually they reach a hockey-sticks curve and start accelerating faster and further than anyone would have originally realized. 

   This is what I see happening with Blue Origin, while the first 20 years might seem slow I see a point (perhaps when New Glenn starts maturing [mid 20's]) When Blue begins a period of exponential growth and expansion in their space operations, perhaps in the late 20's or early 30's right about this time I expect New Armstrong will make it's debut and I think it could be something far more than we might initially expect, look at the scale difference between New Shepherd and New Glenn as a predictor of this trend.

   I recently had some speculation about what New Armstrong could be and I'd like to share that with everybody here, not only is it more than we might expect but I believe that this vision fits Bezos's vision like a glove. New Armstrong in my idea is 4 Things, a system and not just a super heavy class launch vehicle. This system is centered on four main parts, a methalox booster stage, a LEO shuttle, a large station transfer station in LEO, and a lunar shuttle. 

   Allow me to explain why this model fits Bezos's vision so well.
 
   What good is sending tourists into space if they have nowhere to go? a large transfer station would give tourists riding on Blue Origin rockets a place to go, and it would also allow for two other vital things besides tourism, a place to store fuel for outbound lunar shuttles, and a transfer point for logistics. Lunar bound payloads could be offloaded in LEO transferred to a Lunar shuttle that has been fully fueled and sent there without having to do this all at once.
   
   Bezos has expressed the importance of building vital infrastructure for smaller space entrepreneurship, a station would give these entrepreneurs a place to do their work as well as a port to operate out of. The booster stage of the New Armstrong system would be similar to New Glenn's booster stage merely scaled up, my guess is that is will be somewhere in the 10-12 meter diameter range and because of it's size will preform a boost back burn to return directly to the launch site rather than landing on a ship like New Glenn. The next part of the system would be the LEO and Lunar Shuttles, In general they would have much in common but also many key differences, They would both be cylindrical in shape and be built on the same assembly lines with the same tooling but would serve rather different functions. The LEO shuttle would be fitted with a heat shield as well as several dynamic control surfaces for rentry and landing (much like BFR) I would also expect this vehicle to use a vacuum version of BE-4 Becuase higher thrust for launches to LEO is better for minimizing gravity losses, The lunar shuttle on the other hand would be very different. The lunar shuttle would launch on top of the booster but would never come back to land on earth ever again, instead it would dock and rendezvous with the LEO transfer station where it would be refueled and sent on trans lunar injection to land at a moon base. The lunar shuttle would have approximately the same shape as the LEO shuttle, perhaps a little longer due to the lesser density of it's hydrogen fuel, but would have no heatsheild and permanently fixed landing legs, all in all a simpler vehicle. After completing it's mission on the moon it would be refueled there from the water ice at the poles and insert itself back into LEO propulsively where it would dock with the transfer station and get ready to return to the moon. All in all this system would develop many of Blues skills including, In space construction (for the transfer station) Re-entry and landing capabilities from the LEO shuttle, Water ice mining and Lunar Ops for the lunar shuttle as well as in general boulstering the backbone of a space economy through transport infrastructure on a level we have never before seen in the past. 

   To sum up all I've said, I think Blue origin will make New Armstrong dedicated to infrastructure rather than just as a traditional launch vehicle for customers to help fulfill their long term vision, they will also IMO focus a division of the company on space stations and in space construction and manufacturing, so as to one day have the skills to build they giant space habitats that Jeff Bezos is so fond of.

BlueOrigin,"   Clearly part of Jeff Bezos's motivation for founding Blue Origin was Gerard Oneill's ""High frontier"" concept of Cislunar and eventually most of the solar system's space being populated with giant rotating space megastrucutres in where humans could have access to much more habitable space than being confined to earth. Supplemented by the mining of asteroids, the solar system could eventually support trillions of humans. My question is however about the social and economic consequences of this plan.

   Of course early on in the construction of these rotating megastructures, rents on these space colonies will likely be quite high as the cost of getting into space will be far less than it is now, but still not as cheap as airline travel or something comparable, My question is this. What is to prevent an Elysium type situation from occurring in where the wealthiest of earths population decides to leave for these rotating megastrcutures and the poor are left on earth?

   Surely nothing good could come from this, and I could only imagine that the situation on earth would degrade further, with capital investment leaving as well as a higher proportion of people living in poverty, Earth wouldn't be preserved nearly as much as Jeff Bezos had hoped, in fact the situation kind of reminds me of Blade Runner, earth suffers degradation because the wealthy and well off have left for the off-world colonies.

Looking at data from today's NS-10 launch, it accelerated 13.4 ft/s\^2 early on in the flight between the 10 and 15 sec marks, roughly 110 ft/s - 43 ft/s, so 110-43 / 5 = 13.4

It claims 110,000 lbf of Thrust, so 110,000 lbf - (m\*32ft/s\^2) = m\*13.4 ft/s\^2 (resulting force)

Customer | Experiment Details
:-:|:-:
Carthage College Space Sciences Program |The Modal Propellant Gauging experiment led by Dr. Kevin Crosby is a joint effort with the NASA Kennedy Space Center Cryogenics Laboratory. It demonstrates a way to measure fuel levels in microgravity by using sound waves.
Controlled Dynamics Inc. | The Vibration Isolation Platform (VIP) aims to separate payloads from the normally occurring vibrations experienced during spaceflight. The payload led by Dr. Scott Green allows researchers to have a clear understanding of microgravity’s effects on their research results.
Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab | On its second flight with Blue, the EM Field experiment will observe and collect data on the naturally occurring electromagnetic fields both inside and outside New Shepard during the launch. Principal Investigator Dr. Todd Smith will use success of this experiment to determine how global measurements of the Earth’s electromagnetic field can be conducted in the future.
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center | Cooling tightly-packed electronics onboard a spacecraft can be challenging, and many solutions have not been able to undergo robust testing. Principal Investigator Franklin Robinson will test one of these solutions in his Flow Boiling in Microgap Coolers experiment.
NASA Johnson Space Center |  On its third flight on New Shepard, the Suborbital Flight Experiment Monitor-2 (SFEM-2) led by Dr. Katy Hurlbert will analyze various aspects of the flight environment during New Shepard’s mission profile, measuring cabin pressure, temperature, CO2, acoustic conditions, acceleration and more. The data collected will help future researchers on New Shepard design the most effective experiments for the vehicle.
Purdue University | Dr. Steven Collicott’s payload looks at Zero-Gravity Green Propellant Management Technology, which aims to help advance the use of a safer and more environmentally friendly rocket propellant by better understanding the fuel’s behavior in microgravity.
University of Central Florida | Two teams led by Dr. Josh Colwell and Dr. Addie Dove both have planetary science payloads on NS-10. The Collisions Into Dust Experiment (COLLIDE) aims to understand how dust particles react after surface contact during exploration missions to places such as the Moon, Mars and asteroids.

It was originally an Engineer II position, but I only have 4 years experience (they were asking for minimum of 5), so they are going to have to modify it to an Engineer I position. 

He said “don’t worry about the title right now, just have a number in your head that you expect for salary. Blue won’t do that for you, we want you to tell us what you want, and go from there.” 

I’ve never had this happen before, I’ve worked at TI and Raytheon where there is zero negotiation on salary. 

I ran the numbers on it, and to have the same standard of living in Seattle as I have now, I’d have to make 115k. I also would like to get a liiiitle bit of a bump, so I thought I’d ask for 118k. Does this sound reasonable?

BlueOrigin,"So, it's my understanding that the long term goal for blue origin is to move heavy industry to the moon. My interpretation of this is that they want to move manufacturing of the machinery that makes our civilisation tick, but pollutes the world, to space, so things like steel production or even manufactured goods like cars, planes and ships. If that is the case, what is the plan for getting those goods back to earth from space? Re-entry is hard and I would have thought sending mega-tons of payload in through the atmosphere would generate a lot of heat, which could even go some way to offset the environmental gains.

Blue moon is nice but the cargo capacity is limited to about 4,500 kg to the lunar surface because the second stage has to send the mass of itself as well as the blue moon lander into LEO before TLI, therefore most of the fuel and ergo most of the payload capacity. However what if New Glenn's second stage was refueled in LEO? Has anyone here done the calcuations of how much mass could be thrown on TLI?

* BFR style ; Integrated seconds stage/payload faring with hatch style payload release mechanism and side mounted heat sheild. Along with adequite aero control surfaces for manuvering in the atomosphere. 

* Kistler/Early falcon 9 concept style ; Front mounted or possibly an inflatible heatsheild design on the front of the second stage.

* Horizontal landing style, Intergrated second stage &amp; spaceplane that delivers the payload to target orbit, re-enters the atomosphere, autonoumously flies back to a runway.

BlueOrigin,"I'm curious if Blue themselves will find the research and design for habitats or if they will be more apt to use a 3rd party. It seems from how we can see their progression with both rockets and now blue moon, that they will likely develop some early habitats first. Potentially they could use New Shepard's suborbital flights to gather data on micro gravity and see how their environmental systems hold up. Using this information they could develop smaller habitats and then look to build larger ones. With Bezo's plan for trillions in the solar system I would think that he would keep R&amp;D of space habitats in house. What is this subs opinion?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/9qq990/will_blue_origin_create_their_own_in_space/
BlueOrigin,"Currently the partially reusable New Glenn has a payload capacity of about 45 tonnes to LEO in the first iteration of it's operational design.
 As we've seen with the Falcon 9 however the payload capacity and overall power through Engine upgrades/ stretches of the launch vehicle itself have yielded a near doubling of initial payload capacity, for example Block I of falcon 9 had a fully expendable maximum payload to LEO of about 10 metric tonnes. (which likely would have been less than half of that if Space X had attempted partial re usability on block I) In only eight years we have seen Falcon 9's expendable payload capacity double to around 22 metric tonnes to LEO, with all this being said my question is this.
      Could we potentially see New Glenn's partially reusable payload capacity grow in a similar fashion in the years after it starts flying? Could it approach 90 metric tonnes to LEO and potentially compete with BFR before the advent of New Armstrong? 
What do you guys think?

BlueOrigin," Hi There,  


Moving heavy industry from Earth into space is at the core of Blue Origin’s mission. The future will be better for our children – and our children’s children – if we use space to benefit life on Earth and enable millions of people to live and work in space.  
   
The next logical step in this path is a return to the Moon. To do this we need reusable access to the lunar surface and its resources. We’re in the conceptual design phase of a large lunar lander that will provide that access called Blue Moon.  
   
We are not alone in our drive to return to the Moon, and there have been some exciting updates this week at the 69th Annual International Astronautical Congress in Bremen, Germany.  
   
Blue has joined leading space companies and agencies to support the creation of [The Moon Race](https://blueorigin.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ca4c14684ac1af3f1219b4382&amp;id=7cef927497&amp;e=ea7008150c), a non-profit working to launch a competition for teams looking for a ride to the lunar surface. The goal is consistent with our aim to land large payloads on the Moon that can access and utilize the resources found there. We’re supporting this initiative, along with ESA, Airbus, and other entities seeking to foster the next generation of lunar exploration – with Blue Moon and New Glenn.  
   
We’re also excited to announce a collaboration with OHB SE and MT Aerospace on a [future Blue Moon mission](https://blueorigin.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ca4c14684ac1af3f1219b4382&amp;id=3a78b71971&amp;e=ea7008150c).

BlueOrigin,"I did some pixel-counting of the latest [New Glenn image here](https://i.imgur.com/C0wsvbr.png), and this is what I came up with: 

Old 3 stage New Glenn: 313 ft
Old 2 stage New Glenn: 270 ft
Latest version of New Glenn: 308 ft

Essentially, the booster is the same height and the second stage got a lot bigger. 

Old second stage: 36 ft
New Second stage: 53 ft

So basically, the new second stage has a volume 50% larger than the old second stage. Given that methalox is around 2.25 times as dense as hydrolox fuel, though, this represents much less fuel mass. However, hydrolox gives around 20% more ISP than methalox, and less fuel mass means the booster doesn't have as much to lift, so ends up producing a higher DeltaV. I'm not sure exactly what the overall performance change is, but I'd guess the new hydrolox second stage is probably similar in capability to the old methalox upper stage. So in all likelihood, despite the rocket getting larger, it hasn't dramatically changed in payload capabilities from the old 2-stage version.

BlueOrigin,"   For a company that's stated goal is to have ""Millions of people living and working in space,"" I am quite frankly amazed that We haven't heard so much peep about an actual crewed orbital craft that could start actually transporting people into LEO. Despite the current lack of information, there are three things that we do know for certain 

* New Glenn will have a Crew Vehicle. 
- The hostess of NS-8 on the Blue Origin Livestream mentioned that people who had flown on new Shepard would be given first priority for tickets aboard New Glenn's crew vehicle into orbital space.
* BO is targeting crewed New Glenn launches to start between 2025-2026.
- Rob Meyerson has previously stated that he thinks that New Glenn will begin orbital manned launches is about 7-8 years, While seemingly less ambitious than some of the timeframes that SpaceX has ascribed to their BFR, I think that this is a decidedly more realistic timeframe when you're orbital rocket hasn't even flown yet.

* Blue Origin did already design a Manned Orbit-class Crew Vehicle but it has most certainly changed radically from that initial design. 
- Back around 2011, BO submitted a Commercial Crew proposal to NASA that involved a small (Dragon V2, Cst-100 sized) Biconic Crew Vehicle that would be capable of carrying at most a crew of 7 into LEO, While this was their proposed crew vehicle at the time things have most certainly changed, at the time BO's First Orbital rocket was supposed to be similar in capacity to earlier iterations of Falcon 9 or the lesser powered configurations of the Atlas 5, Now BO is planning a Super-Heavy Lift (According to Robert Zubrin likely close to 60 metric tonnes to LEO with new dual Be-3u upper stage) launch vehicle as it's first Orbital Rocket with a 7m diameter to boot, so the design has most certainly been changed to accommodate these updated parameters. 

      I Personally Speculate that the design teams at BO will go one of three ways with their crew vehicle.

* Option 1 ; 7m Integrated upper stage crew vehicle (Similar to BFR)
- Vehicle would have a dry mass of about 30 metric tonnes, and would have it's crew cabin located on top with fuel tanks and engines located directly below along with a side mounted heat-shield and a lifting body re-entry profile, Whether or not BO would resurrect BE-4 vac or just decide to use the BE-3u engine is anybody's guess, but it would no doubt be a smart way to introduce a crew vehicle as well as full upper stage re-use at the same time on New Glenn, assuming that there would also be a cargo version (Again similar to BFR). Their are obvious downsides to this design decision though, Mostly stemming from the fact that the vehicle would need to carry it's heat-shield everywhere it went -which would cut into dry mass, not to mention the need to carry extra re-entry control surfaces as well as one or more sea-level engines for landing propulsively on the surface of the Earth. This vehicle could likely fly 20-30 people into orbit at once and at a lower cost that CST-100 or Dragon 2 (but not likely lower than BFR) since Full re-use would for sure make tourist/ Civilian seats to orbit far cheaper than if the second stage was expended at the end of every launch simply leaving a dead-weight capsule in orbit. If orbital re-fueling was implemented this vehicle could also be used on missions beyond LEO, to Lunar orbit or even to the Lunar surface if the vehicle uses Hydrolox, since it would likely need to re-fuel on the Lunar surface.  

* Option 2 ; 7m Biconic Crew capsule 
- Weighing about 20 metric tonnes, this vehicle would enable a crew of about 20-30 people to go into Orbit and would either propulsively land back on Earth or would land via parachutes and airbags like the New Shepard Capsule or CST-100. It would essentially be a scaled up version of what BO submitted to Nasa in 2011. Since it would be a dead weight payload, it would need to be connected to a in-space tug to go anywhere beyond LEO and the Second stage would have to be recovered by alternate means (say a front mounted heat-shield or a ballute), The main advantage of this vehicle over option 1 is that it would have significantly lower development costs and would be able to be operational sooner after development was initiated.

* Option 3 ; 5m 7-10 person Crew capsule
- Likely weighing less than 10 metric tonnes, this vehicle would not take as much of an advantage of economies of scale as the other two options nor would it be as ground breaking or innovative, but it would be easier to send onto TLI because of it's smaller mass and would likely be more adept for serving the near future crew transport market, ex. ISS replacement or bigelow Ba-330 derived private space stations. It would also be the cheapest option in terms of development cost, for a smaller vehicle it would require a tapered inter-stage since New Glenn has a main body diameter of 7 meters.      
               
    In the end this is just my estimation of what BO might do regarding a crew transport vehicle that will fly on New Glenn, What do you guys think? Comment below and let me know.

BlueOrigin,"SpaceX substantially improved the performance of Falcon 9 since first launching.  Do you think BO will do the same with NS by increasing the length of the fuel tanks or the power of the BE3?

Some sounding rockets go to altitudes of 1000 km or more, while the current NS goes to just over 100 km.  How much extra value would going to 1000 km offer?

At 1000 km, the earth would take up just 120 degrees of the view vs 160 degrees at 100 km.  That's 33% less - a lot more spacey feel.  Free fall would last 8 minutes longer.  What would that be worth to you?  How much more value would that be for a tourist visit to space?  Would it be enough for you to think, ""Wow, earth is small.  We better take care of this thing and war is just insanity?""

BlueOrigin,"Let's face it.  New Shephard is a gimmick allowed because someone designated a certain altitude as ""space"".  It has almost no value.

New Glenn will be a real launch vehicle, but it won't do anything to bring man to space.  It likely won't substantially beat Falcon 9 or Falcon H on price.  It's good for America and freedom loving people the world over to have redundancy, but it's not worthy of Bezos's ambitions.  

BFR is the only project in motion that will truly advance humanity towards space.  BO needs to get on the bandwagon.  And, truth be told, if BFR succeeds, every other launch vehicle will become antiquated.

This is Blue Origin's 2nd launch of 2018 and 9th launch in total of this suborbital New Shepard type booster and capsule hardware type. Similarly to the last flight of NS-2 last year, this launch will include a test of the escape motor in the crew capsule, unlike the last test of this type, this escape test will not be performed at maxQ but at a much higher altitude. Jeff Bezos mentioned via Twitter; ""We’ll be doing a high-altitude escape motor test — pushing the rocket to its limits,"". These are the final tests that need to be completed before the spacecraft is ready for passenger operation, space.com has noted ""If the test program continues to go well, New Shepard could begin operational flights as early as this year, Blue Origin representatives have said. The company has not publicly revealed how much it will charge for a seat aboard the suborbital vehicle.""

This is Blue Origin's 2nd launch of 2018 and 9th launch in total of this suborbital New Shepard type booster and capsule hardware type. Similarly to the last flight of NS-2 last year, this launch will include a test of the escape motor in the crew capsule, unlike the last test of this type, this escape test will not be performed at maxQ but at a much higher altitude. Jeff Bezos mentioned via Twitter; ""We’ll be doing a high-altitude escape motor test — pushing the rocket to its limits,"". These are the final tests that need to be completed before the spacecraft is ready for passenger operation, [space.com](https://space.com) has noted ""If the test program continues to go well, New Shepard could begin operational flights as early as this year, Blue Origin representatives have said. The company has not publicly revealed how much it will charge for a seat aboard the suborbital vehicle.""

BlueOrigin,"Trying to put together some thoughts I've been having for awhile:

I have a hunch that the future of Blue Origin will look like the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). AAP was the original plan for human spaceflight in the 1970s after the Apollo program met its initial goal of landing people on the moon. It was an ambitious program of space stations, large uncrewed platforms, and lunar base construction.  Some features:

-Saturn I for orbital transport, Saturn V for deep space transport
-Habitats derived from Saturn upper stages
-Uprating the Apollo CM to carry 6 astronauts for LEO missions
-Uprating the LEM to take all 3 astronauts to the lunar surface, stay for longer,  and/or act as a temporary base. 
-Cargo only version of the LEM
-converting the LEM ascent stage into a space telescope

It's obvious that one of the main design drivers behind AAP was a desire to reuse as much of the moon landing hardware as possible. NASA was aware even in the mid 60s that R&amp;D funding was going to tail off after Kennedy's goal was met so AAP was conceived as a way to have an ambitious human spaceflight program by leveraging existing investments. As we all know AAP was scrapped by Nixon in favor of the shuttle.

Blue has continuously said that their major focus is rockets. Bob Smith even goes so far as to say that they're a propulsion company at heart. We know that Bezos wants to develop at a minimum three launch vehicles; New Glenn, New Shepard, and New Armstrong, to lower the cost of accessing space. Each of these vehicles represents a significant investment in engines, in manufacturing, and in technical expertise. They are building a giant factory in Florida to support New Glenn and I imagine a similar investment will be made for New Armstrong. Their entire organization seems for the most part geared towards launch vehicles, rocket engines, and capsules.

I've always been skeptical that launch is all that is needed to develop space. Other necessary pieces of infrastructure would include landers, depots, habitats, and servicing craft. My hunch is that if Blue Origin decides to build any of this then commonality with the launch infrastructure is going to be a major design driver. You see this with Blue Moon which tries to utilize New Shepard technology to do a LEM sized lunar lander. If Blue decides to do habitats then they're going to be based off of New Glenn or New Armstrong tankage. Launch vehicles are one of the few space products that are sort of mass-produced whereas habitats, landers, and depots might be one offs for a while. It doesn't make sense to double the size of the company or build a new factory to produce a single habitat module when they can just tap off from the people and tooling they already have.

I could also be totally wrong. SpaceX is right now betting the farm on making breaks with the past. Red Dragon was supposed to be the quickest path to Mars but it has been scrapped in favor of going right for BFR. I've even read articles that for the money it cost to build and the number of years it will be operational (assuming BFR is flying by 2020's) that Falcon Heavy might not have been worth it. Adapting three Falcon-9's into a heavy lift launcher was much harder than it seems and that it might have just been quicker to move to a wider rocket from the start.

Bezos also has more money than God and could probably build his own habitats, depots, and landers from the ground up. ",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/8gchot/blue_origin_applications_program/
BlueOrigin,"What’s  the deal with Kent? Will they build parts of the New Glenn there and then ship it to Florida to assemble? If so, how will they do that?

* Has BO said anything about the design of this manned orbital Spacecraft that they plan on building?

* Assuming that it is rapidly re-usable do we expect this Spacecraft to be a separate Spacecraft or integrated with the newly announced duel Be-3u upper stage (Kind of like BFR) as a way of developing upper stage re-usability

* What kind of payload/passenger capacity could this 7m spacecraft have?

* Could it have orbital refueling Allowing it to perform TLI burns and send humans/ cargo into cislunar Space?

- If anyone has any information or better insights then I would like to hear it.

BlueOrigin,"Blue Origin plans to build the New Glenn from the ground up with reusability of the first stage through retropropulsive landing in mind.

They have some Grasshopper-like experience with New Shepherd, but given the massive size of New Glenn it might make sense for them to first test a scaled-down variant of the first stage (a la F9R Dev) with fewer than 7 BE-4s.

Are there any indications that Blue plans to use such a test vehicle before (or in parallel with) building the full-scale New Glenn?  If so, they'd likely test it sometime next year to keep the 2020 debut of NG.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/8drmwv/be4_grasshopperf9r_dev/

BlueOrigin,"Hi everyone 

It is well known that the BE-4 engine is being developed in partnership with ULA. But what about the other techs? Are there any other companies collaborating with BO? I think that they develop most of the techs themselves, just like SpaceX, but maybe I’m wrong. I’ve also always been curious about how and where they get their materials and propellant.

BlueOrigin,"   I'm sure that most of the people who follow commercial spaceflight closely are aware that the overall architecture for New Glenn has changed pretty significantly in recent months. 


   Originally the plan for New Glenn was to have a vehicle boasting 3 engine types, a first stage powered by 7 Lox/LCH4 SL Be-4's, a second stage powered by a single Vac Be-4u and an optional thrid stage from GEO &amp; deep space mission that would be powered by a single or possibly multiple Lox/LH2 Be-3u's. As of recently that Architrcture has been radically simplified.   


Instead of using a Lox/LCH4 Be-4U second stage with a single engine  BO has switched to a duel engine Be-3u configuration which uses hydrogen instead of the originally propesed methane fuel. Per this change I was wondering if anyone had done the math to see how New Glenn's preformance has changed, the primary questions that come up in my mind are these.

1. Since Hydrolox is less dense than Metlox, how much has the second stage being stretched to accommodate the new fuel?

2. By how much and in which direction has LEO has LEO payload changed? Although I understand that thrust is now lower, hasn't the upper stage gained like 80s of Isp and not to mention become a lot lighter when fully loaded with fuel and oxidizer my own two cents tells me that LEO payload has increased but IDK for sure.

3. How much has GEO direct insertion payload changed, surely it's increased?

4. How does this affect Blue Origins long-term goals, Does this pivot to Hydrolox for the second stage mean that second stages will be re-used as lunar tugs? How does this affect Blue Origins manned ambitions? Lunar ISRU refueling?

5. How does this affect new Armstrong development, has new Glenn been simplified to allow New Armstrong development to follow sooner so as to compete with BFR?

BlueOrigin,"Hey all, so the ULA development plan is to first upgrade the Centuar from 3m to 5m for use on the Vulcan first stage. Then they will be adding the ACES kit, and then sometime after that SMART for the first stage. The last major item is the XEUS kit for 5m Centuar for all the obvious uses.

My question is given the close relationship with ULA and same fuel type being used on both the NG 3rd stage and the Centaur could we see BO license the ACES and XEUS tech for a BO space tug? 

If so I'd like to see the math on a 7m ACES and XEUS, if any of you are smart enough to math that out I'd appreciate it.

Thanks!",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/87knt4/7m_xeus/
BlueOrigin,"Intro 

* It has previously been stated by Rob Meyerson at Blue origin that they hope to be able to fly humans on New Glenn in ""7-8 years"". If this is true then Blue Origin must be looking to develop a manned capsule capable of transporting Humans to LEO and potentially further. Using what we know I think I have an idea for how initial manned Lunar missions facilitated by blue origin will work.

Step 1 (2024-2025) 

* Blue Origin will launch a number of commercial (probably Bigelow) habitats, radiators, solar panels to build a station at EML-1, after the station is complete it will serve as a joint between the LEO - EML-1 stage of the journey &amp; the EML-1-Lunar surface part of the journey. In addition to the modules, Blue origin will launch several Blue Moon landers to dock with the station so as to provide lunar surface access.

Step 2 (2026-2027) 

* Crew + cargo bound for the moon launch aboard a BO crew capsule into LEO, after the Orbit insertion stage separates the Capsule + New Glenn third stage remain in LEO and orbit a few times before doing a direct injection burn for the EML-1 station, After a few days of coasting the Crew arrive and transfer cargo into the Blue moon lander, where they undock from the station to set up an initial Lunar base with rudimentary ISRU capability. After their mission, they launch aboard the Blue Moon landers and Dock with the EML-1 station once more and transfer their extra hydrolox fuel to the Capsule + NG third stage stack which allows the crew to return to Earth. All subsequent New Glenn Third stages are reused and pick the NG capsule up form LEO and take it to EML-1 where the process is repeated for routine lunar surface access.

BlueOrigin,"So I've been writing a Sci-Fi novel slowly but steadily over the past 3 months or so and takes place in 2068. I have seen where the main character is describing the history of spaceflight and I know for sure that the race Between SpaceX's BFR (Flying since 2024) and Blue Origins New Armstrong (Flying since 2032) is going to be a huge part of this scene.

 Now I've described BFR in great detail in this scene, but to do it justice I would also like to describe New Armstrong is great detail as well, now before you accuse me of engaging in wild speculation I'd just like to say that this is all for fun and I'm not asking for some detailed figures such as TWR for the main engines or Isp, but rather the configuration and rough size of the vehicle.

 Part of me wants to make the fictionalized New Armstrong a Larger scale copycat of the BFR (I.e the, proverbial 747 &amp; a380 of early-mid 21st-century spaceflight) but the other part of me wants to make it something completely different form BFR in terms of how similar the architecture is to what SpaceX is developing.

BlueOrigin,"New Glenn is an amazing vehicle from what is being proposed, In a standard 2 stage configuration with re-using the first stage, it will be able to launch 45,000 kg into a 200 km x 200 km LEO.

 New Glenn also has a key advantage over the SpaceX Falcon series in it has a 7 m x 21 m payload fairing that is far less volume constrained and offers space for some amazing things like the large commercial moon landers, Space tugs, interplanetary probes, Bigelow ba330 habitats, etc. Now 45,000 kg is a lot (about what the Saturn V put on trans-lunar injection) But given the lesser concerns on volume, there are potentially even larger payloads (Airforce orbital weapons/ maybe some private space station parts) that would be in the super heavy class range.

 My question is there any way that the Be-3u hydrolox third stage could be used to allow New Glenn to loft even heavier payloads into LEO (similar to the Saturn V flight profile) while still reusing the first stage. If so then I would be very interested to see how much more than 45,000 kg New Glenn could loft (If anyone would do the math on this they would be a homie to me) and what some potential applications of this could be?

* Intended as a direct competitor to SpaceX's BFR for commercial cargo flights to lunar and Mars bases as well as the assembly of space stations in Earth orbit and launching entire satellite constellations all at once.
* 15 - 18-meter diameter
* stack height 100 + meters tall (squatter than new Glenn or BFR)
* Second stage ship with side mounted heatshield (similar to BFR) 6 - 8 methalox (Probably different from BE-4 or BE-2 vacuum engines) with both cargo only and crew only interior configurations.  
* 260-300 tonnes of LEO (Fully reusable)
* 75 + tonnes to GTO (direct insertion)
* 200 + passengers in crew configuration
* 300 - 400 tonnes to Mars (with orbital refueling and cargo loading)
* Launched from LC - 39D (completed by 2030)
* Booster preforms RTLS maneuvers and lands on the launch mount
* Operational by 2030 (7 or 8 years after announcement)

BlueOrigin,"This is an attempt to gather information about when New Shepard will fly next. Earlier in the year we were told New Shepard would have an unmanned test, then move to test pilots by the end of 2017 and have paying customers in 2018. I have been looking around for info about when the next New Shepard flight will be and this is what I have come up with so far. Feel more then welcome to add anything about the status of New Shepard.  

Here is an older article talking about the expected flights in 2017 https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15105684/blue-origin-new-shepherd-crew-interior-photos-tourist-space

""'We have a new upgraded version of New Shepard that has actually been shipped to the launch site, and we’ll be flying again before the end of this year,' Mowry said at  Euroconsult’s World Satellite Business Week here. 'We hope to have human flights in 2018. It’s designed to take six astronauts into suborbital flight above the Von Karman line.'""

BlueOrigin,"Hello /r/BlueOrigin!

I am a Brooke Owens Fellow Alumni, a Chemical Engineer Graduate from UCSD and a Propulsion Engineer at Virgin Orbit. This past summer, I participated in the Brooke Owens Fellowship Program which offers aerospace internships in engineering, policy, business analysis, venture capital, communications, education, airport operations and more to undergraduate women pursuing careers in the aerospace industry. In addition to internships at the industry's top companies, each Fellow is paired with TWO executive mentors in the aerospace industry, one within her company and one outside of her company. These mentors include two most recent Deputy Administrators of NASA, multiple CEOs, award-winning journalists, astronauts and more. My personal mentor was a veteran of five Space Shuttle flights and seven spacewalks named Scott Parazynski (we are friends on Facebook now!!!!). On top of that, I met 36 intelligent women who shared the same passion as mine: Space.

This fellowship was the best outlet for the aerospace industry and endless opportunities. So please spread the word to benefit other women!
 
The application information can be found on the Brooke Owens Fellowship website. Applications are due December 5th!

This is going to be Blue Origin's first launch with a brand new engine and new fuel, very different flight path and flight characteristics and WAY more thrust.  I think there are good engineers working hard on this rocket however it IS rocket science, something is bound to go wrong with all that new hardware.


Also I didn't see any cold gas thrusters in the launch concept video which are pretty much essential if you want to turn the booster around at 120ish km like SpaceX have been doing. Fins just aren't going to cut it up there.
Also could a booster that size land on such flimsy landing legs?

BlueOrigin,"[New Glenn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEhohh6eYk&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I promised a revised analysis a while back and only just now getting around to posting it.  

[This version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhbaivoynsw160q/NG%20Design%20Round%202.xlsx?dl=0) has the same basic assumptions as the previous post [(found here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/60llhq/new_glenn_mass_estimates_based_on_payload_to/). Given the limited information available on the New Glenn and BE-4 I had to use some of the basic equations and some external sources ([Braeunig.us](http://braeunig.us/space/index.htm) is a great resource for simple stuff like this) to find a rocket design that closely matches the published measurements.

I limited the T/W range to a much smaller series (1.25-1.37) and that seems to agree within 6m of the height estimates of 82m for the two stage and 95m for the three stage configurations, so I am declaring victory! I also used hemispherical dome volumes on the tanks which I believe is the reason I actually achieved the height estimates for the given payload mass.

Tab {2.4} TW=1.25, actually matches height within 0.8m and 0.2m of the two and three stage versions, respectively. Worth checking out.

Comments, questions, fears, and are welcome.

Enjoy!

[edit] Fogot something of note, if my stage masses are accurate (mostly the hydrolox S3) then a single NG launch is capable of boosting the Orion to TLI. IMO that is a brilliant strategy, allow yourself to back up SLS and it gives you an in with NASA and certain Congress critters who may be persuaded to fund some development/missions for a Blue Moon lander

BlueOrigin,"Hi guys, I just watched the New Glenn introduction video and  got quite hyped, a very sleek looking rocket with an interesting take on reusability and commercial space flight.
Nevertheless, I got some questions:

1) Why did Blue Origin choose to land New Glenn just like New Shepard, with a Burn-to-hover and a subsequent landing instead of landing directly without a hover burn?
Isn't that inefficient? I would guess maybe with a hover the landing can be more precise?

2)Is there more data for BO rockets in general and New Glenn in particular? As an engineering student, I dig them datasheets.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/6lkbz2/new_glenn_questions/

BlueOrigin,"Review: https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blue-origin-logo.jpg

So in the above image we see 5 arcs which we know the first 2 map to:
3.6 km/s  = Reusable suborbital rocket system named New Shepard.
9.5 km/s = Reusable LEO/GEO orbital rocket system named New Glenn.

The next 2 here are logical assumptions: 
13 km/s = Reusable Cis-lunar rocket named New Armstrong.
19 km/s = Reusable Mars/Asteroid belt scale rocket named TBD. (I assume we will know this name in the next decade)

And my wild guess: 
20 km/s = Reusable intraplanetary spaceship system named TBD 

The reason I assume the 5th vehicle will not be a rocket is because the delta-v is only 1km/s more. This implies a radically different type of vehicle with slightly more delta-v. Robert Heinlein says 10km/s is ""halfway to anywhere"".  Well that means 20 km/s from LEO is therefore ""anywhere and back"".  See:
https://i.imgur.com/SqdzxzF.png
And visualized a better way:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/ebf6D.png
This vehicle will not land on the surface of hard bodies, it will be a true spaceship which is built in space and refueled there. This will be the minimally viable ""trans oceanic"" cargo vehicle of the solar system.
Basically it will fly along the ""tops"" of the gravity wells in the above image. 

My baseline ""spaceship"" is something like this:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus-X
I assume Jeff will do something much larger and interesting. 
Anyone care to take a stab at size/capabilities of rockets 3 and 4, and spaceship 5?

Thanks!

BlueOrigin,"I get the feeling that the internet in general (and reddit) believes that SpaceX's ITS is a much surer bet and will fly much sooner than any comparable BO rocket (such as New Armstrong), but I'm of the opposite opinion. While I *really* hope both of these projects are successful, I do think BO has some major advantages in resources and scheduling, given the present situation.

We all know a great many things will be required for SpaceX's ITS and BO's New Armstrong, but in my view the big ones are:

&amp;nbsp;

*1. Lots of money for development*. In this respect, BO is in much better shape, as they have all the money they need thanks to Bezos, while SpaceX does not have the same level of resources. 

&amp;nbsp;

*2. R&amp;D*. It seems likely that new Armstrong will be cheaper, faster, and less complicated to build than ITS (with much less R&amp;D), as it will probably be a scaled-up version of New Glenn (same engines, similar general design). ITS, on the other hand, is a good deal more complex and ambitious while also being quite different from Falcon 9/Heavy. 

&amp;nbsp;

*3. An entirely new factory, built either at the launch location, or on the coast* (due to booster diameter preventing movement by road). BO will have a factory meeting these requirements soon (albeit not tooled for New Armstrong, but certainly capable of it), while SpaceX doesn't even have plans for a facility like this yet.

&amp;nbsp;

I think once New Glenn is flying around 2020 ([per Jeff Bezos](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/blue-origin-releases-details-of-its-monster-orbital-rocket/)), New Armstrong will be a short step forward for BO. They'll have the funds, the factory space, and most of the R&amp;D done. If we give them a generous three years to hammer out New Glenn booster landings and get the final iteration of the New Glenn design done, by 2023 or so they'll probably have the data to start New Armstrong construction, and be flying around 2025. 

&amp;nbsp;

SpaceX's ITS schedule is much harder to quantify. I believe Elon himself mentioned ITS construction might take a decade or so at the current rate, which seems like a fairly realistic number. While SpaceX is working hard to get the R&amp;D out of the way, they don't have the money right now to start building/acquiring the factory facilities required for ITS, and they can't use the ones they already have. They're working on getting the money, but in order to do so they have to focus on getting commercial operations rolling, and that's been somewhat slower than they originally forecast. Once SpaceX actually starts executing on a plan to acquire ITS factory space, I think we're around 4 years out from ITS booster flights, and 5 years out from ITS flights. But that's the key. Until we hear more about actual ITS factory space, ITS is just a paper rocket (albeit backed up by more and more data and R&amp;D as time goes on). 

&amp;nbsp;

On the other hand, BO has been moving dirt for awhile, and will soon have a setup capable of bending metal for New Armstrong (minus some tooling, although I expect a lot of commonality between New Glenn and New Armstrong). Consequently, if I had to bet on one of these rockets, I would place a much higher probability on New Armstrong eventually launching than ITS, and probably sooner (by at least a year or two). 

&amp;nbsp;

Another thing that would be interesting to quantify is how much SpaceX's schedule delays are affected by their very high employee turnover rate. In my experience, high turnover tends to lead to project delays due to lack of continuity and experience. BO appears to have much lower turnover than SpaceX, and seems to be generally well-liked as a career company (as opposed to SpaceX, which has bad long-term employee retention rates). This may reduce BO's risk of project delays. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, does this analysis seem accurate? In what ways do you agree or disagree?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/6b0hnr/is_bos_new_armstrong_more_likely_to_eventually/

What about health care? Are premiums/deductibles/copays reasonable for a family? Are there any retirement incentives available (401k matching, stock options, etc)?

Any idea of what I should expect for salary? I'm currently making ~$120k/year. Is it reasonable to expect at least the same at Blue Origin in an Industrial Engineering type of role? Are most new hires from a referral or is it easy to make it through without one?

BlueOrigin,"[New Glenn](https://youtu.be/BTEhohh6eYk)

[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8mzqw6disijbfyc/NG%20Design.xlsx?dl=0) are my initial estimations for the New Glenn launch mass and potential as a vehicle for exploration. I want to start this discussion on the /r/BlueOrigin community, I hope to update some of this in the coming months as more information becomes available. 


Let me start by saying the only guarantee I can make is these numbers WILL be wrong. The known parameters used to arrive at these estimations are: 

(1) Sea level thrust of the BE-4

(2) Number of engines in S1 and S2

(3) Chamber pressure of the BE-4

(4) (Old) comments by Bezos on the thrust and Isp for the BE-3U

(5) Payload to LEO and GTO for the 2 Stage configuration

(6) Landing technique and some comparison data from the F9 gathered on /r/spacex

(7) A slide rule, and some good old armchair rocket science (okay maybe not the slide rule)


I did not attempt to estimate the mass of those “Stingray Strakes” on the S1, I did use the video to estimate the wing area assuming a 7m diameter core I got roughly 35m^2 which is roughly equivalent to the wing area of an F/A-18. I generally have preferred the 1,300mt for this analysis, it yields a higher T/W ratio for the 2 stage variant which allows for a faster burning of the S1 propellant (better for landing maneuvers) and still has enough payload margin to launch a relatively large (nearly S-IVb class) hydrolox S3 with little determent to the performance of the lower stages. In this configuration, the 350mt S2 easily allows for S1 recovery with sufficient landing propellant margin and still meet the quoted 45mt to LEO, 13mt to GTO numbers. As with others I had some trouble with getting the length figured out, I am beginning to wonder if the 7m diameter is referring to the engine base diameter and the tank diameter is actually ~6m, even that doesn't solve the problem though.




-*Tab {1}* outlines the engine performance numbers used in the analysis

-*Tabs {2}* outline the total vehicle performance with payload to LEO and GTO for different launch mass estimates (labelled based on the T/W at launch) 

-*Tab {3}* allows **YOU** to mess with the launch mass number and find your own optimization points for the two stage variant from the engine specs page and the stage mass variants

-*Tabs {4}* outline the general performance for the 3 stage variant based on the 1,300mt vehicle outlined in Tab {2}. Tab {3} is further divided into two different S3 masses (85mt, and 100mt). Interestingly enough if you just require the S3 to perform the TLI burn and use onboard payload propulsion to perform LOI you can lift 30mt direct to TLI, space station modules, Orion and landers are all within reach

-*Tab {5}* IMHO is the most important of all this, it outlines the potential for the NG to launch substantial propellant loads to LEO for mating with heavy loads already in orbit and launch them to important destinations like the moon, mars or gas giants in as little at **TWO** launches.




I surmise (even prior to NG announcement) that vehicles capable of 40-50mt to LEO are the minimum required to begin large scale exploration, colonization and expansion into space. For many reasons these vehicles are more than capable of carrying average commercial payloads for revenue to cover much of the infrastructure costs, they have sufficient mass to make them durable and capable of reuse and they have margins necessary to provide large propellant deliveries to LEO. Under the analysis performed NG shows an excellent capacity for enabling both heavy deep space launches and normal LEO services.


Let me know what you think, opinions and recommendations are encouraged. Anyone is welcome to use this for other work just add my name in there somewhere

**TL;DR** Two stage New Glenn has a 1,300t launch mass (sans payload) and is capable of lifting 45mt to LEO, 13mt to GTO. With the addition of a large hydrolox S3 (~100mt) it is capable of lifting 15mt directly to low lunar orbit and back to earth return trajectory in a single launch. Using a two stage to launch a 45t to LEO and a 3 stage to launch the S3 (no payload) you can directly place 45mt into low lunar orbit. In short, **what can Blue do for you?**",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/60llhq/new_glenn_mass_estimates_based_on_payload_to/

BlueOrigin,"Another mailing list update from Blue Origin: 

&gt; Although the BE-4 turbopump is smaller than your refrigerator, it generates 70,000 horsepower from a turbine running at nearly 19,000 revolutions per minute that pumps cryogenic propellants to pressures just under 5,000 pounds per square inch. To react the forces generated by the rotating turbine and impellers inside the pump, production rocket turbopumps to date have used traditional ball and roller bearings. For BE-4, we’re doing something different – we’re using hydrostatic bearings.

&gt; A hydrostatic bearing relies on a fluid film supplied by a high-pressure source to provide support for the shaft and cause it to float without contacting the static structure except at startup and shutdown. The BE-4 main turbopump uses hydrostatic journal bearings for radial support and hydrostatic axial bearings to carry axial thrust. The system is bootstrapped. The high pressure fluid films for the bearings are supplied by the propellants themselves – liquefied natural gas and liquid oxygen – tapped off from the pump discharge flows.

&gt; Material selection is a critical consideration for this approach, as there is physical contact between the bearing surfaces during the start transient before the fluid film is fully established and during the shutdown transient as the fluid film dissipates. With lab-scale tests and full-scale bearing rig tests using actual pump hardware, we evaluated over 20 material combinations in over a hundred tests, leading to our baseline material and coating choices.

&gt; Extensive rotordynamic and computational fluid dynamics analyses have shown the feasibility of this design, and recent powerpack tests confirmed that this approach works during the startup and shutdown transients – the most critical phases. The shaft orbit plot below shows that the turbopump lifts off smoothly and centers during a typical start transient, demonstrating a smooth ride on a film of propellant.

&gt; Why do we go to all this trouble instead of just using traditional bearings? Engine life. We’re relentlessly focused on reusability, and properly designed hydrostatic bearings offer the potential for longer engine life without refurbishment. This is one of the many engineering decisions we’ve made that we hope will lead to reusability – not just in principle – but to practical, operational reusability. If “reusability” requires significant refurbishment, inspection, and re-validation between flights, then it simply won’t lead to the far lower launch costs we need to achieve our vision of millions of people living and working in space.

&gt; We’ll keep you up to date as our testing progresses in the coming weeks.

BlueOrigin,"I've seen a lot of people putting New Glenn between Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy in terms of payload mass capability. This was my initial thought, but it turns out that the [Falcon Heavy 54,400 kg lift](http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities) capacity is for expendable launches. According to Musk, [the reusable mode Falcon Heavy will have 30-40% less lift capacity](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/726559990480150528) which puts the payload mass to LEO between 32,640 kg to 38,080 kg. The New Glenn, which will have 45,000 kg to LEO for reusable launches, can therefore **deliver about 18% to 38% more payload to LEO than FH**.

I don't think that NG will be offered as an expendable rocket, but if it were, using the 30%-40% ratio, NG would be able to launch 64,285 kg to 75,000kg to LEO. My guess would be that the true number is closer to the lower end since it looks like NG is not really designed to fly as expendable, for example the Falcon rocket family can fly without legs and gridfins but NG has integrated legs and would likely not remove the strakes and actuated fins.

Doing the same calculation for GTO, NG is slightly below Delta IV but much higher than FH**. Also keep in mind that this is the two stage variant of NG and the three stage will likely have extremely high performance for GTO compared to similar launch vehicles. Those are numbers that have not been released.

To summarize:



 | Delta IV Heavy | Falcon Heavy (reusable) | New Glenn (reusable, 2 stage variant | Falcon Heavy (expendable) | New Glenn (expendable, two stage variant)
---|---|----|----|----|----
Mass to LEO (kg) | 28,790 | 32,640 - 38,080 | 45,000 | 54,400 | 64,285 - 75,000
Mass to GTO (kg)| 14,220 | 8,000**| 13,000 | 22,200 | 18,570 - 21,670 

**As far as the FH, I'm not sure what the exact mass to GTO is for reusable launches. The SpaceX site says 8.0 mT for ""Standard Payment Plan"" so I assume this is the reusable mode. If we do the calculation based on 30% to 40% reduction, the mass to GTO would be  13,320 kg to 15,540 kg.


Down the road, purchasing an expendable FH would only make sense for payloads between 45,000kg and 54,000 kg (unless expendable FH is cheaper than reusable NG which is unlikely). Even then, three stage variant of NG would likely be a better option given the much larger fairing volume and a much cheaper (my personal prediction) launch cost since NG will still be reusable and does not involve parallel staging.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/5ygtaa/new_glenn_payload_mass_to_leo_is_18_38_greater/

BlueOrigin,"&gt;Robert Goddard’s first rockets used compressed gas to force the liquid propellants into the engine thrust chambers. While simple in design and a logical starting point, he quickly realized the limitations with this approach: it requires thick-walled heavy propellant tanks and limits the engine’s chamber pressure and performance, both of which limit payload capacity. The answer was turbopumps. Store the propellants in low-pressure light tanks, and then pump the propellants up to high pressure just ahead of injection into the main chamber.

&gt;For even more performance, you can add one or more boost pumps ahead of the main pumps. We’ve done that on the oxidizer side of our BE-4 engine. Our Ox Boost Pump (OBP) design leverages 3-D additive manufacturing to make many of the key components. The housing is a single printed aluminum part and all of the stages of the hydraulic turbine are printed from Monel, a nickel alloy. This manufacturing approach allows the integration of complex internal flow passages in the housing that would be much more difficult to make using conventional methods. The turbine nozzles and rotors are also 3-D printed and require minimum machining to achieve the required fits.

&gt;The OBP was first demonstrated last year in testing, where we validated its interaction with a main pump. The second iteration of the OBP for BE-4 is now in test. We’ve also just finished assembly of the unit that we’ll install for the first all-up BE-4 engine test.

&gt;We’ll keep you posted on how our BE-4 powerpack and engine testing progresses.

BlueOrigin,"Blue Origin's New Shepard booster will most likely take one (or more) people above the 100 km Karman Line and into space sometime in 2017. The question is: Since there are no pilots, who will the first passenger(s) be? The answer is: We don't know. Therefore we will have to speculate. And since Richard Branson wants to be one of the first passengers on Virgin Galactic's 'Unity' spacecraft, is it safe to assume that Jeff Bezos will want to be the first Blue Origin passenger?  Not sure, but whoever it turns out to be will look awfully impressive with a pair of astronaut wings pinned to their chest!

BlueOrigin,"I'm struggling to understand the benefits of using New Shepard as a Space Tourism vehicle in Blue Origin's stated goal of advancing spaceflight. I don't see how it's a profitable endeavor. 

If we assume Blue Origin is going to sell tickets at $250,000, like Virgin Galatic, you'd have to launch ~75X in a year to generate the same revenue of 1 orbital flight. 

Since NS' capsule carries 6 people, you can figure they'll sell 5 of those seats. You'd want at least 1 employee on board to ensure everything is proceeding safely and the passengers are behaving. 

That gives you a revenue of $1.25M per flight.

The going rate for an orbital flight these days is between $80M and $120M depending upon services.

I see them losing money on NS tourism but gaining experience. I see this as helping to fund their institutional knowledge as they learn how to have a high launch cadence. I see this as them learning how to carry passengers safely. If they can put a few million in their pocket while they are learning, great. But, I don't see this as a long-term profitable endeavor. 

They can gain all the same knowledge as they work to recover New Glenn from the first few launches. 

Am I off here? It just seems to me that there are way easier ways to earn $100M than doing ~75 successful flights. It seems to me that there are easier ways to learn how to recover an orbital class first stage than doing 75 sub-orbital hops.

BlueOrigin,"I thought [multiple engine types multiplied costs](http://www.airspacemag.com/space/is-spacex-changing-the-rocket-equation-132285884/)?
&gt;Musk says that overhead starts with how the launch vehicle is designed. The workhorse Atlas V, for example, used for everything from planetary probes to spy satellites, employs up to three kinds of rockets, each tailored to a specific phase of flight. The Russian-built RD-180 first- stage engines burn a highly refined form of kerosene called RP1. Optional solid-fuel strap-on boosters can provide additional thrust at liftoff, and a liquid hydrogen upper stage takes over in the final phase of flight. Using three kinds of rockets in the same vehicle may optimize its performance, but at a price: “To a first-order approximation, you’ve just tripled your factory costs and all your operational costs,” says Musk.

&gt;Instead, from the very beginning, SpaceX designed its Falcon rockets with commonality in mind. Both of Falcon 9’s stages are powered by RP1 and liquid oxygen, so only one type of engine is required.

Also, there's this. Unless New Glenn will have a reusable third stage, there might be a problem of [the rocket being less cost-optimized for reusability](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/20qjvz/former_arianespace_chief_says_spacex_has/cg67rq6/).

&gt;Because for these rockets [i.e. Atlas V] the first stage is the cheapest part, most of the cost of the vehicle is in the upper stages since they use LOX/LH2, advanced materials, advanced engines, and so on. The RL-10 engine, for example, which is used on both the Delta and Atlas, costs nearly $40 million alone*. Even if the 1st stage of the Delta IV or Atlas 5 is provided for free from a magic leprechaun the cost of the rocket isn't going to get lower than the cost of the RL-10 plus the rest of the 2nd stage construction. Making the cheapest part of the vehicle cheaper just don't help overall cost of the rocket.

~~*while an expendable Falcon 9 v1.2 is $60 million for about twice the payload of an Atlas V 401~~

edit: you get the idea, $40 million is a significant fraction of the cost of a Falcon 9 launch.

It's good that the ""commonality"" philosophy is being applied with the two-stage version of the New Glenn (methane/liquid oxygen BE-4 engine used on both stages), and a third hydrolox stage *does* indeed have advantages for sending payloads on high-energy trajectories beyond Earth orbit. But is it worth it when you have the risk that comes with additional separation events, as well as more manufacturing and operational costs, and potentially less cost savings during reuse unless all stages turn out to be reusable? And recovering three stages would be a pain operationally if the launch market got to the point where rapid reusability is needed.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/5hf3by/about_new_glenns_hydrolox_third_stage/

BlueOrigin,"You've probably seen [my post asking if anyone had been to a Blue Origin launch before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/55rhig/anyone_here_ever_watched_a_blue_origin_launch/)  Well, thanks to the great feedback from /u/SPACEVINE, a cool boss that let me take a day off with little notice, and a supporting spouse, I was able to view today's launch in person.

I originally started out with a rambling, stream of consciousness telling of my experience.  For the sake of brevity, I decided instead to break it down into a couple of things.  The 'mechanics' of watching a Blue launch and the experience.

Prior to space vine's info I had found nothing about watching a Blue launch.  The company doesn't say anything about it, and it still such a small, new company not many people come out.  Van Horn is pretty middle-of-nowhere West Texas.  Most of the people there were from neighboring communities, maybe 2 hours away at most.  Once you get off I-10 in Van Horn there's a well maintained state highway that heads north.  After about 15 minutes or so of zooming around mountains and up and down hills you come around the bend and see the valley were Blue does the launches.  The VPF was easily seen off in the distance.  As I got closer you'd start to see 1 or two cars pulled off here and there on the side of the road.  I ended up parking near the main gate.  There's a decent sized gravel pull-off on the side that fit probably 10-20 cars.  I was told that if you went much further up the road you'd encounter the Sheriff.   The road wasn't closed but they were telling people that beyond that point they couldn't stop on the side of the road for some number of miles.  I had a cheap pair of 10X50 binos I had bought on the way down.  You could easily see the rocket and launchpad.  The landing pad was a bit further north and I had to strain a bit to see the landed rocket, but it's doable.  The people that showed up were friendly and from a wide variety of ages/backgrounds.  It was pretty informal.  Someone (Blue?  TXDOT?) had obviously put in that gravel pullout, but otherwise the whole thing seemed pretty hands off.  Blue's there to do its thing, and hey if you want to watch, good luck, you're basically on your own.  Also for most of the ride I had no cell signal with Verizon, but it sounded like a couple of people had a decent connection, so YMMV.

Now the experience.  If you haven't seen a launch, I highly recommend it.  Seeing it on video is one thing, but feeling the thunderous sound of the rocket (even a 'small' one like NS) is quite the experience.  Same with the sonic boom from the rocket just as it landed on the pad in the distance.  The sense of scale afforded by being there in person provides perspective.  Seeing the rocket fall in video is one thing, watching is screaming out of the heavens at some ungodly speed with your own eyes is quite another.

All in all, I'd say it was worth the drive (how much, depends on you) and would recommend it to anyone.  I'm guessing as things ramp up it might be busier/crazier out there, so if you are able I'd say go to one sooner than later.

One of the people at the spot I parked was dating someone at Blue.  One of the more interesting things they shared it it sounded like there was very little refurb of the vehicle between launches.  It sounded like they basically patch up the TPS on the bottom, as needed, and it's pretty much ready to go again.  (I'd love to see one where they launch 2-3 times in a day).  It sounded like they'll start flying people in the next year, and there's an internal lottery amongst employees about who gets to go on some of those first test launches.  When I asked if they had heard anything about BE-4, I was told they're aiming for January, but I don't know how old their info is.

If anyone has any questions, I'll try and answer them. I wanted to experience the launch, not be distracted by recording/photographing it.  But I did take some pics.  I'll post some later, if any are decent.

UPDATE:  [Posted an album online](http://imgur.com/a/D6tXv)  Keep the following things in mind:  I'm not a pro photographer.  Any pics taken during launch were basically me slamming down my binoculars and snapping a few quick shots, then watching the launch again.   I purposefully didn't edit/crop most of the pics, so you'd have a sense of perspective and get a feel for what it was like to watch it in person (should you decide too). My binos were able to get in a bit closer than my 200mm zoom, but you get the idea of what it looks like to see it in person from a distance...",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/563x7o/my_experience_of_watching_a_blue_origin_launch_in/

BlueOrigin,"I was considering driving a few hours out to Van Horn to see the launch on ~~Thursday~~ Wednesday. However, information about public viewing of launches is non-existent, especially compared to other established launch sites.  Before I potentially wasted my time I was hoping someone might have had experience so I know its a ""Oh yeah, you can see it off in the distance from the side of the road..."" or a ""No good, they close off the highway 20 miles in either direction"" kind of thing.  I've never seen a launch so I'm excited at the possibility, and I figured if you get a chance to see a rocket launch, what better than one where it's expected to blow up at some point.  I'm also dropping a note to BO, but I don't know if they'll get back to me in time.

UPDATE:  I decided to roll the dice.  After many hours of late, late night driving I'm in the area.  Much to my surprise and disappointment when I went to get a feel for the rest of the drive in the morning to the area near the launch site I now notice a note on Google Maps saying the road is closed, and pretty well before the area I had intended to drive to to view the launch = \  The Texas DOT site lists no road closures in the county...  I guess we'll see what happens in the morning, but I hope to see at least *something*.

UPDATE2:  Now that I'm back home Im going to try and do a quick writeup on my experience.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/55rhig/anyone_here_ever_watched_a_blue_origin_launch/

BlueOrigin,"**Welcome to the Blue Origin New Shepard NS-2 in-flight escape test discussion thread**

This is Blue Origin's 4th Launch this year and 5th launch of this suborbital New Shepard booster and capsule hardware. This vehicle has flown and landed successfully in Nov 2015, Jan 2016, Apr 2016 and Jun 2016. This thread is an open discussion of any information you want to post about the live webcast coverage.

**Launch Mission:**

&gt;We’ll be doing our in-flight escape test with the same reusable New Shepard booster that we’ve already flown four times. About 45 seconds after liftoff at about 16,000 feet, we’ll intentionally command escape. Redundant separation systems will sever the crew capsule from the booster at the same time we ignite the escape motor. You can get an idea of what will happen in this [animation](https://youtu.be/N5i-f-D_A-M). The escape motor will vector thrust to steer the capsule to the side, out of the booster’s path. The high acceleration portion of the escape lasts less than two seconds, but by then the capsule will be hundreds of feet away and diverging quickly. It will traverse twice through transonic velocities – the most difficult control region – during the acceleration burn and subsequent deceleration. The capsule will then coast, stabilized by reaction control thrusters, until it starts descending. Its three drogue parachutes will deploy near the top of its flight path, followed shortly thereafter by main parachutes.

TL;DR: At approx T+45s and 16,000ft an anomoly signal will be sent and the capsule will be jettisoned. A solid motor will be triggered and will push the capsule away from the booster at great speed.


**The Booster:**

* Due to the nature of the test it is unlikely the booster will survive, which is why we're not going to do landing bingo. Sorry.

&gt;This test will probably destroy the booster. The booster was never designed to survive an in-flight escape. The capsule escape motor will slam the booster with 70,000 pounds of off-axis force delivered by searing hot exhaust. The aerodynamic shape of the vehicle quickly changes from leading with the capsule to leading with the ring fin, and this all happens at maximum dynamic pressure. Nevertheless, the booster is very robust and our Monte Carlo simulations show there’s some chance we can fly through these disturbances and recover the booster.

* Remember things don't always go to plan, space is hard so (unplanned) failures are possible or as Jeff put it on the last flight:

&gt;As always, this is a development test flight and anything can happen.

Rob Meyerson, President of Blue Origin will be making a presentation at the 67th International Astronautical Congress from Guadalajara, Mexico. The presentation will discuss Blue Origin's long and short term goals as well as past successes and failures, hopefully the talk will enlighten us as to some of the finer points of New Glenn, as well as some of New Shepard's next steps towards being human rated and on into being used for space tourism flights. I'd like to say we'll hear a little about New Armstrong but I don't want to jinx anything!

**How Can I Watch?**

**It looks like there will be no stream of this particular presentation, we will keep you updated on with all the info we can**




**Where?**

This year the IAC is being held at Guadalajara, Mexico.

**What is IAC?**

&gt; Every year, the International Astronautical Federation together with the International Academy of Astronautics and theInternational Institute of Space Law (IISL), holds the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) which is hosted by one of the national society members of the IAF.

&gt; They are an annual meeting of the actors in the discipline of space, and are generally held in late September or early October. They consist of plenary sessions, lectures and meetings. The IAC is attended by the agency heads and senior executives of the world's space agencies.

Ok we're not going to pretend this speech isn't being a little over-shadowed by Spacex's mars announcement, ([which can be followed on their sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/54itnx/rspacex_mars_architecture_announcementiac_2016/)) but don't be too hasty in thinking that Blue Origin don't have anything too major up their sleeve.

I believe the naming system is based on the furthest location a human passenger could go. So while the ""New Glenn"" could send robots to other locations it will be limited to only sending humans to LEO. This makes the ""New Armstrong"" the human lunar development rocket. 

According to my eyes the road map says: 
3 km/s = New Shepard, 
9.5 km/s = New Glenn, 
15 km/s =  New Armstrong, 
19 km/s = ???, 
20 km/s = ???, 

Using some delta V maps (please link your favorite) Ceres looks about 19 km/s away. 
The mystery is why is the 2nd unknown rocket has only a 1 km/s improvement? 
I think it is because the first 4 will be designed to launch from Earth where the 4th represents an end state ""in space only"" transportation system in line with the following quote: 

""When it comes to space, I see it as my job, I'm building infrastructure the hard way. I'm using my resources to put in place heavy lifting infrastructure so the next generation of people can have a dynamic, entrepreneurial explosion into space.""

If you are going to have millions of people living and working in space I think this represents the ship which will fly between the infrastructure, most importantly fuel depots refueled from the ice in the asteroid belt. 

Thoughts?

BlueOrigin,"If Robert Zubrin's [comment is to be believed](https://twitter.com/robert_zubrin/status/775365975034114049), New Glenn should have an expendable payload to LEO of about 70 tonnes. While I'd expect it to be used in reusable mode most of the time, what payloads would justify using a rocket that big in fully expendable mode?

Here are two that I could think of:

1. Launching Europa Clipper to Jupiter. An Atlas 5 launch would take take 6 years to get to Jupiter. SLS could get the probe to Jupiter in less than 2 years using a higher energy direct transfer orbit. Is there an orbit available that would allow you to split the difference, and direct launch to Jupiter a bit slower than SLS, but without the multiple flybys a smaller Altas-V class of launcher would need?
2. The smallest version of the Bigalow 2100 station was guesstimated by Bigalow to mass in at about 70 tonnes. This is right at the limit of what NG would be capable of, but if it were possible I think this would be worthy of an expendable flight!

Can you think of any other missions that would warrant an expendable launch?

BlueOrigin,"&gt;Our next flight is going to be dramatic, no matter how it ends.

&gt;Like Mercury, Apollo, and Soyuz, New Shepard has an escape system that can quickly propel the crew capsule to safety if a problem is detected with the booster. Our escape system, however, is configured differently from those earlier designs. They mounted the escape motor on a tower above the capsule – a “tractor” configuration – the escape motor would pull the capsule away from a failing booster. But because a capsule cannot reenter Earth’s atmosphere or deploy parachutes with a tower on top, the tower, along with the escape motor, must be jettisoned on every flight – even the nominal flights. Expending an escape motor on every flight drives up costs significantly. Further, the jettison operation is itself safety critical. Failure to jettison the tower is catastrophic.

&gt;The New Shepard escape motor pushes rather than pulls and is mounted underneath the capsule rather than on a tower. There is no jettison operation. On a nominal mission, the escape motor is not expended and can be flown again and again. We’ve already tested our pusher escape system, including many ground tests and a successful [pad escape test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l8aQ3hQyVs), but this upcoming flight will be our toughest test yet. We’ll intentionally trigger an escape in flight and at the most stressing condition: maximum dynamic pressure through transonic velocities.

&gt;Capsule in-flight escape testing was last done during the Apollo program. From 1964-1966, in-flight escape tests were performed with Apollo simulator capsules using an expendable booster called the [Little Joe II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqeJzItldSQ). We’ll be doing our in-flight escape test with the same reusable New Shepard booster that we’ve already flown four times. About 45 seconds after liftoff at about 16,000 feet, we’ll intentionally command escape. Redundant separation systems will sever the crew capsule from the booster at the same time we ignite the escape motor. You can get an idea of what will happen in this [animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5i-f-D_A-M). The escape motor will vector thrust to steer the capsule to the side, out of the booster’s path. The high acceleration portion of the escape lasts less than two seconds, but by then the capsule will be hundreds of feet away and diverging quickly. It will traverse twice through transonic velocities – the most difficult control region – during the acceleration burn and subsequent deceleration. The capsule will then coast, stabilized by reaction control thrusters, until it starts descending. Its three drogue parachutes will deploy near the top of its flight path, followed shortly thereafter by main parachutes.

&gt;What of the booster? It’s the first ever rocket booster to fly above the Karman line into space and then land vertically upon the Earth. And it’s done so multiple times. We’d really like to retire it after this test and put it in a museum. Sadly, that’s not likely. This test will probably destroy the booster. The booster was never designed to survive an in-flight escape. The capsule escape motor will slam the booster with 70,000 pounds of off-axis force delivered by searing hot exhaust. The aerodynamic shape of the vehicle quickly changes from leading with the capsule to leading with the ring fin, and this all happens at maximum dynamic pressure. Nevertheless, the booster is very robust and our Monte Carlo simulations show there’s some chance we can fly through these disturbances and recover the booster. If the booster does manage to survive this flight – its fifth – we will in fact reward it for its service with a retirement party and put it in a museum. In the more likely event that we end up sacrificing the booster in service of this test, it will still have most of its propellant on board at the time escape is triggered, and its impact with the desert floor will be most impressive.

&gt;The test should be in the first part of October, and we’ll webcast it live for your viewing pleasure. Details to come.

&gt;If someone forwarded this email to you and you’d like to subscribe to get these updates yourself, you can do so [here](https://www.blueorigin.com/interested). In my next email update, I hope to give you a sneak peek of the orbital vehicle we’ve been working on for the last few years.

BlueOrigin,"&gt;On our most recent flight, we performed a test to prove the Crew Capsule could safely land with only two of its three parachutes open. On a nominal flight with all three parachutes deployed, the capsule descends at about 16 mph before firing a retrorocket just a few feet above the ground.  This retrorocket firing is what creates the large cloud of dust you see just before the capsule lands, and slows the capsule down to 3 mph before it touches the ground. This last bit of speed is absorbed by a ring shaped crushable bumper made of aluminum honeycomb material mounted on the bottom of the capsule. The ring is made of eight segments.

&gt;On this last mission, with one chute intentionally failed, the capsule was descending at 23 mph before firing its retrorocket. The retrorocket took out most of that velocity, and the crushable ring did the rest of the job. Below, you can see a couple of pictures of the crushable after the flight test. The first picture shows it mounted under the vehicle after we lifted it off the ground post-flight. The second picture shows a side view of the eight segments after we removed them from the vehicle. Even with one chute out, the crushable barely crushed. When new, the crushable is about 5.5 inches high and can crush down to less than one inch high, providing a constant deceleration force as it crushes. After the mission, the crushable was still over 5 inches high along nearly the entire circumference of the ring.

&gt;We’ve designed the capsule to ensure astronaut safety not just for a failure of one parachute, but even for a failure of two parachutes. In addition to the retrorocket system and the crushable ring, there is an energy absorbing mechanism mounted underneath each seat.

BlueOrigin,"&gt;We broke ground on our orbital vehicle manufacturing site in Florida.

&gt;The 750,000 square foot rocket factory is custom-built from the ground up to accommodate manufacturing, processing, integration and testing. Among other things, the facility hosts large scale friction stir welding and automated composite processing equipment. All of the vehicle will be manufactured in this facility except for the engines. Initial BE-4 engine production will occur at our Kent facility while we conduct a site selection process later this year for a larger engine production facility to accommodate higher production rates.

&gt;I’ve included some photos that will give you an idea of what the vehicle manufacturing facility will look like in December 2017 when it’s complete.

&gt;It’s exciting to see the bulldozers in action--we’re clearing the way for the production of a reusable fleet of orbital vehicles that we will launch and land, again and again.

BlueOrigin,"I gathered some data based on the speed and time from the live webcast from flight 4 of the New Shepard. Assumed the rocket is going just straight up and down, which is a simplification, but accurate enough for this application.    
[Data vs altitude](http://i.imgur.com/aRFDjsO.jpg)  
[Data vs time](http://i.imgur.com/hJuBeoB.jpg)  
  
Some observations:  
- Initial TWR of about 1,5.     
- Thrust is reduced 15sec before MECO, likely to achieve passing the Karman line with maximum fuel reserves for landing.  
- 'Weightless'/free-falling time of about 200sec, or 3min 20sec.  
- Significant effect of atmosphere on acceleration only occurs well below 40km altitude.  
- The 15sec of 5mph constant landing speed costs somewhat below 150m/s delta-v extra compared to a suicide burn.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/4pwyf1/analysis_of_telemetry_from_webcast_from_launch_4/

It was going through how much money billionaire lost by the dip in global economies and the NYSE as a result of brexit, and it listed Bezos as losing 1.8 billion. Now, it's the NYSE, so im sure most of that will bounce back, but. What effect could that have on blue origin? None? Is Bezos not putting any more of his money into BO, just that initial start?

To maintain a fast pace, we’ve elected over the past years to invest heavily in key machines, tooling and people for the production of BE-4 so we can control critical processes in-house.

BlueOrigin,"You might remember the Apollo 15 capsule had one parachute fail during its return to earth prompting the recovery ship USS Okinawa to radio to Worden, Irwin and Scott in the Command Module “You have a streamed chute. Stand by for a hard impact.”

 [Parachute failure on Apollo 15](http://imgur.com/5idkzwC)

A parachute failure is a credible scenario in even the most carefully designed recovery system, so a robust vehicle needs to accommodate that possibility through redundancies and margin designed and built into each subsystem that protects the astronauts during landing. The New Shepard crew capsule is designed to safely land the crew even in the event of a parachute failure.

As I mentioned briefly in the last e-mail, we’re about to do that test. In addition to redundant parachutes, the crew capsule is equipped with a two-stage crushable structure that absorbs landing loads, along with seats that use a passive energy absorbing mechanism to reduce peak loads to the occupant. As an added measure of redundancy, the crew capsule is equipped with a “retro rocket” propulsive system that activates just a few feet above the ground to lower the velocity to approximately 3 ft/sec at touchdown. This final maneuver causes the dust cloud you can see when the crew capsule lands.

We’re planning to demonstrate the redundancies built into the capsule on this re-flight of the vehicle by intentionally failing one drogue and one main parachute during descent. This should occur around 7 ½ minutes into the flight at an altitude of 24,000 feet.

Our other goals for this mission include continuing to learn about our reusable architecture by actually reusing it (this will be the fourth flight of the same hardware), further demonstrating the predictability and repeatability of vehicle performance, and executing pre-planned flight control maneuvers on the booster and crew capsule via fin deflections, TVC deflections and RCS firings to observe system response in order to reduce modeling uncertainties.

We’ll provide a heads up when we know the flight date, but it will likely be before the end of the month.

BlueOrigin,"Back in March, we shared with you our efforts on building two new test cells to further support risk reduction testing on the BE-4.  We began the construction of these additional facilities in October last year and we’ve just commissioned the first of these cells last week.  This test cell is pressure fed and supports the development of the preburner start and ignition sequence timing that will be used on the upcoming full scale powerpack test campaign.  As mentioned in a prior email, one of the many benefits of a privately funded engine development is that we can make and implement decisions quickly. We made the decision to build these two new test cells as a team in a 10 minute discussion.  Less than three weeks later we were pouring concrete and now we have an operating pressure fed test cell 7 months later. Private funding and rapid decision making are two of the reasons why the BE-4 is the fastest path to eliminate U.S. dependence on the Russian-made RD-180.


[Commissioned Preburner Test Facility (thanks /u/old_sellsword)](http://i.imgur.com/hbc8UzT.jpg)

This new pressure fed facility is capable of supporting full scale preburner risk reduction.  If you look closely, you’ll see we already have the 14 inch diameter test article integrated into the facility ready for initial testing.  More on that as we have it.
 
We’re also finishing our mission planning for another flight of New Shepard, which will be our fourth flight with this vehicle.  One of the fundamental tenets of Blue Origin is that the safest vehicle is one that is robust and well understood.  Each successive mission affords us the opportunity to learn and improve our vehicles and their modeling.  We have stepwise expanded our flight envelope on the booster and crew capsule on every mission. On our most recent flight, we performed maneuvers on the crew capsule to help characterize its aerodynamics and reduce our model uncertainties. On this next mission, we’ll execute additional maneuvers on both the crew capsule and the booster to increase our vehicle characterization and modeling accuracy.
 
On this upcoming mission we also plan to stress the crew capsule by landing with an intentionally failed parachute, demonstrating our ability to safely handle that failure scenario.  It promises to be an exciting demonstration.  We’ll be sharing more with you about the upcoming mission as we have it.

BlueOrigin,"Another newsletter update from Blue Origin:

&gt;In the BE-4 preburner, a very small portion of the engine’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel mixes and burns with all of the engine’s liquid oxygen to produce hot gaseous oxygen, which is used to drive the turbine and spin the turbopumps. Oxygen and LNG burn stoichiometrically above 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and temperatures of about 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit or more are needed to reliably ignite and sustain the reaction. No practical turbine materials would survive at that temperature, especially in a reusable application. To resolve this, the BE-4 preburner mixes unburned oxygen into the burned gas stream to dilute the combustion gases and reduce the overall temperature to about 700 degrees Fahrenheit. If this mixing process isn’t meticulously designed, hot spots can persist in the stream and limit turbine life.

&gt;To design the preburner to provide uniform temperature, we use 3-D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to model the LNG and liquid oxygen combustion process. CFD predicts fluid behavior by solving the Navier-Stokes equations to describe how the velocity, pressure, temperature, and density of a moving fluid relate. CFD of reacting flows, especially those that also involve a phase change, is much, much harder because it must also solve chemistry along with state equations. Combusting CFD has only become practical with recent advances in chemical physics models and computing power.

&gt;*[Combusting CFD modeling of the BE-4 preburner shows temperature distribution of hot gaseous oxygen entering the turbine](https://i.imgur.com/ufeI0wv.png)*

&gt;To date, we’ve completed several million core hours of CFD modeling of BE-4 combustion processes. Modeling of the preburner shows good mixing and temperature uniformity upstream of the turbine. The combustion and temperature data we’ve gathered in our subscale testing correlate with our CFD predictions and show that our preburner sizing and injector element design meet design requirements. The ability to do combusting CFD simulations doesn’t eliminate the need for rigorous testing, but it will significantly shorten the test-fail-fix loop on the test stand. We’ll keep you updated.

BlueOrigin,"A while ago I read the book ""The Rocket Company"" by Patrick Stiennon, in which he describes a two-stage reusable rocket. He explains that the first stage of the rocket (DH-1) launched straight up more or less (though there was some adjustments due to the spin of the Earth) and afterwards landed, vertically, at the launch pad.

Having read that and having seen the landings of the New Shepherd launch vehicle, my question is would the straight up vertical launch profile make sense for the Very Big Brother? 

I ask this because it seems like by going with this ""vertical only"" launch for the first stage of the Very Big Brother, Blue Origin could then leverage the technology and experience gained from New Shepherd and achieve the reusability of the first stage more quickly (I'm assuming the first stage of the Very Big Brother will be derived from New Shepherd)? 

On the other hand I guess there is a disadvantage here in that the first stage would not contribute much to the horizontal acceleration needed to get to orbital velocity... I'm wondering what others think about this?

BlueOrigin,"I just got this email from Blue Origin:

&gt;BE-4 testing is well underway at Blue Origin. To date, we’ve completed more than 170 staged-combustion tests – including 51 starts on a single regeneratively cooled chamber and nozzle. The preburner performed flawlessly and the main injector consistently demonstrated performance at the high end of our predictions, giving us confidence that we’ll get good specific impulse when we go to full-scale engine testing later this year.

&gt;We’re building two new test cells. The first is a high-pressure cell that lets us run short-duration, full-scale isolated preburner tests. We’ll use this cell to refine the ignition sequence and understand the start transients. The second is another full engine test cell. Having two full engine test positions will allow us to further increase the testing pace.

&gt;One of the many benefits of a privately funded engine development is that we can make and implement decisions quickly. Building these two new test cells is a $10 million commitment, and we as a team made the decision to move forward in 10 minutes.  Less than three weeks later we were pouring the needed three-foot thick foundations. Private funding and rapid decision making are two of the reasons why the BE-4 is the fastest path to eliminate U.S. dependence on the Russian-made RD-180.

&gt;Gradatim Ferociter!

BlueOrigin,"....and that the New Shepard is actually a reusable second stage being developed and tested in plain sight with the space tourism angle just a cover?

The choice of hydrogen screams upper-stage and I think we've all guessed that the engines would see double duty in the future on a second stage but....  what if we're looking at the stage itself?

The bottom of the rocket is round, could they be planning on integrating a heat shield so it could survive re-entry from orbital speeds after delivering a payload?  A bigger methalox first stage is probably in the works based on tumors surrounding the BE-4, if they can R&amp;D landing experience on the smaller second stage first, it will probably help when the bigger rocket's ready to fly.

BlueOrigin,"I'm no expert, just trying to calculate/guess the capability of the potential Blue Origin LVs with some maths.

**The engines.**

BE-4 Engine

 * Mass(guess based on RD-191): 2.7t

 * Thrust SL 2400 kN

 * estimating ISP of 315s sl and 340s vac

BE-3U Engine:

 *  mass guess (from J-2 ) 1.2t

 *  Thrust Vacuum 760 kN

 *  vac isp estimate 450s


Also i'm going to use the gross approximation that if a vehicle has adequate TWR, and 9500 m/s Delta-V, then it can reach LEO.

**BB - Single BE-4 Vehicle:**
__________________
Max vehicle mass: 212t (1.15 liftoff TWR)

The vehicle can't possibly weight more then this including payload knowing the thrust of the BE-4

=calculate starting with initial S2 TWR of ~0.68 (relatively typical for a 2nd stage)=
total S2 mass = 95t + fairings/payload

S2 dry fraction = 0.084, based of S-IVB 

upper dry mass 8.0 t

prop mass 87t


g*450*log((95.0+7)/(8+7)) = 8459m/s

this of course leaves about a mass of 109t for S1, this is pretty ridiculous, but would almost work except the there'd be too much of the early flight with low TWR, we'll come back to this.

**Try something more realistic for a single engine booster. try starting with initial S2 TWR of ~1 (unusually high)**

670/g = 68.3, lets say S2 mass is 60, so with average payload initial TWR should be around 1.

S2 total mass: 60t

upper dry mass fraction  0.0917 (S-IVB)

Dry: 5.5

Prop mass 54.5

figures where arrived at by looking at the dry/wet mass of the Saturn V 3rd stage, so approximate, but probably not too far off.

max TWR = 670/(g*(5.5)) = 12.4, this is pretty high with minimal payload, though the deep throttling of the BE-3 makes this less of a problem.
Delta-V(with 10t payload) = g * 450 * log((60+10)/(5.5+10)) = 6653 m/s

diameter 3.6m - height 24.5m

Stage 1:

Total Mass: 152

Dry mass fraction:0.111 based on on DIV-H

Dry mass: 16.9t 

Delta-V(10t payload ) = 2864 m/s
flight TWR 1.15 - ~2.9


g * 327.5 * log(212/(16.9+60.0+10)) + g * 450 * log((60+10)/(5.5+10)) = 9517 m/s

Result: a more normally proportioned LV, but with a High TWR upper, this actually causes a loss in performance, as the upper stage now has a poorer mass fraction than it could have.
payload: 10t to LEO, expendable




**VBB - 3 engine Launch Vehicle.**
__________________
Ok, the fun one, 2 stages, 3 first stage engines, this makes a much more typical looking LV.
Maximum mass of this vehicle should be about 638t, so this masses a bit more than the Falcon 9.


For this, lets use the spec of the 95t mass 2nd stage i calculated first earlier



**Now the 1st stage.**

max 1st stage mass  = 536t

58.3t dry mass

prop mass 454t

TWR 1.15 - 4.3

g * 327.5 * log(638/(58.3+95.0+27)) + g * 450 * log((95+27)/(8.0+27)) = 9569 m/s

So our 3 engine rocket can send 27t to LEO in expendable mode.

Now i don't know the how much you would have to reduce the payload to to be reusable. you probably want to subtract the extremely rough 15% or 30% (RTLS) figures quoted for SpaceX, maybe a tiny bit more because of the lack of suicide burn.

BlueOrigin,"I just developed a crazy new theory on this: https://www.google.de/maps/place/Blue+Origin/@47.4086073,-122.2382102,57m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x54905be955555555:0x884890929e744733!6m1!1e1

(If you want to see the imagery of the 'base' you need to tilt the perspective of the google maps image.)

I think it might be a hub between different modules of a Blue Origin moon or marsbase. Why a hub? Because its the most efficient way of getting around between modules. Also, it has stairs that go all around.
If you extend the circles to the right via an imaginary line further out (I know all of this sounds like a conspiracy theory) you can see a small circle on about the height of New Shepard or a large one below the hub.
Its easy to imagine other modules and a New Shepard functioning as a module itself (modules could be landed as cargo).

I got the idea because the lines and circles look like the connecting rod of a car: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecting_rod#/media/File:Haupt_und_Nebenpleuel_BMW_132.jpg

finally, why would they build a mockup so far at the side of their property that they're gonna run out of space? Probably because they dont want anyone to know that they're building one, yet.

BlueOrigin,"So by now we've all heard about the successful re-use of the New Shephard booster (if any Blue Origin engineers are here, well done, you guys did great!)

My question is, what now? What're Blue Origins plans for 2016?
Specifically:

Now that re-usability of the New Shephard booster is confirmed, what needs to be done for the system to be man-rated and put on the market for suborbital toruism? And is that likely to happen this year, or is that wildly optimistic? As far as I know, there's been no manned test-flights of the system, although unlike Virgin Galactic New Shephards tests have actually done the flight profile it's supposed to do. 

Do we have any idea about the size of Blue Origins orbital rocket design? Are we likely to get more information about it this year?

BlueOrigin,"I was trying to get an idea of how well the BE-3 compares to the RL-10, in particular any authoritative info about its Isp.  I figured hey, why not just ask?  So I submitted a note via their Contact Us form asking for details on the BE-3, specifically about its Isp.  I also took a shot and asked if they have a public date for the next New Shepard launch.

They sent me a nice note the next day and told me what a great, modern, low-cost engine it was.  They also pointed me to the Technology section of their website for info on BE-3 (which I, of course, had already looked at), and said they wouldn't release any information outside of what was posted there.  They also said they couldn't tell me anything about the next launch.

I sort of figured that's what would happen, but didn't hurt to try.  Even though I don't have new info to share, I figured I'd post about it, in case it had occurred to anyone else to try. They've opened up a lot as a company, but they still keep much close to the vest...

Hoping for another NS launch soon.  While they wait for the RTF it would be a small comfort to the SpaceX crowd to see *some* rocket RTLS, even if it wasn't Falcon.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/3mflpl/no_luck_getting_details_about_the_be3/

BlueOrigin,"Jeff Bezos said: I Want To See Millions Of People Living And Working In Space (Bernal Sphere/Stanford Torus anyone?) 

Since he hasn't declared any Mars or Planetary ambitions (and he kinda lost the development race to Spacex so far, even though BO has had a head start of two years). Bezos is not the guy to think small and might even consider stepping down as CEO of Amazon when BO takes off.
Just as Elon indicated that he might not always be CEO of Tesla.

What could Blue Origin possibly do of substance in space?

Also how would they interact with a probably dominant Spacex? (Are they gonna sue everytime Elon does something first?)

BlueOrigin,"I think it is very telling that Blue Origin currently has deals to sell the BE-4 engine to both ULA for the Vulcan, and to Boeing for the XS-1 reusable booster.

Since the Shuttle was designed, hardly any rocket engines have been designed in the US, and those that have (RS-68 for example) were evolutions of previous engines. It is as if the USA decided that after the SSME engine, there was no more point in developing chemical rocket engines.

And here we have this company who has never flown any payload even into a suborbital mission, but has decided to invest in modern rocket engine technology. Even with the engine years into the future, some very respectable companies seem to be jumping on it for their new products. That's just because there is no alternative! 

Aerojet Rocketdyne is planning the AR-1 engine, but they are years behind Blue Origin. And AR-1 would probably not be usable for XS-1 since it needs to be reusable.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/3g3w33/blue_origins_success_shows_the_demise_of_rocket/

While I am not one to read to much into these types of things, I cannot help but wonder if lunar development is BO's long term ambition, similar to the way that Space X had their sight set on Mars at some point in the long term future. Of course I could see the prominent placement of the moon in this video as simply a choice to show something familiar and inspiring, more of a marketing tactic than anything else. It does make you wonder, however, what they plan to do beyond develop this suborbital vehicle and eventually their own orbital rocket.

spacex,"SN5 and SN6 were built together I believe.  SN5 is on the pad now (July 22).  SN6 is not completed and is likely to be scrapped because they developed a new metal alloy and changed their welding techniques for the next model which is SN7.

SN7 was a prototype tank version using new metal and welding techniques that was built to blow up.  They tested it to destruction (kept increasing the pressure until it blew up).

SN8 is the full version Starship with the new metal and welding.

So the plan appears to be to Fly SN5 150 Meters and then skip SN6 so they can go right to testing the new metal alloy version (SN8).

spacex,"That was really beautiful prose but let me translate for the nontechnical people (who don't play KSP):

SN5's Raptor engine is placed off center and will need to tilt and aim slightly sideways or the vehicle will start spinning.

Since the flamy side going down is slightly sideways, in order to be sure the pointy side is up, the whole vehicle will tilt slightly sideways.

However, it may be so slight you won't even notice.

spacex,"They are still working out how to build this.  Fully automating a poorly designed, inefficient, or unneeded process or part is generally a mistake; and it can be expensive lesson to try and replace people on tasks they are (currently) better at.  Even if they get to 2 Starships a week coming off the line, there will likely be steps that don't make sense to automate (as the development and testing effort won't pay for itself).

*\*although it is still important to know you ultimately want to automate it, and possibly mass produce a part, as that plays into the design, material, and process choices.*

That said, partial-automation even at this point can be beneficial.  There are steps that are well enough known that they can increase quality and consistency, and free up the crew to focus on other activities.  Barrels are stacked up quickly due to machine welding, and other parts like the bulkheads would see similar returns.  And even if these processes need to be tweaked, there likely won't be a huge retooling cost.  But fully automating placing and welding on flight components seems premature.

u/Martianspirit pointed out that the Model 3 was a hard lesson in over automation being a costly mistake; but it was also an example of unneeded complexity in product design resulting in an excessive numbers of production steps and a huge amount of money wasted automating that.  Fortunately between Giga Shanghai ramp up they've learned about simplifying production, and with the Model Y design simplifying parts; they are definitely learning lessons \[while still trying to push some innovations into production, at the appropriate time - ie, machine installable wiring conduits which might come in the future, but not yet\]",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fywkc2a/

They seem to have done extensive testing of Raptor, and have proof of concept of how to approach these problems from their experiences with Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9.

I wouldn't want to say these problems are ""easy to solve"" or anything, but the hardest part seems to be having a methodology to approach the problem, and experience with it, and they appear to have that in spades. Meanwhile, they also have no other large distractions to throw the company off course, like we've seen for the past few years.

Hopefully Endeavor lands and validates their crew program, and the next crewed mission goes up without any hitches that move elements of their R&amp;D back onto problems that already seem solved, and do not contribute to Starship development.",/r/spacex/comments/hvbja9/elon_musk_will_attempt_to_fly_later_this_week/fywc20z/

&gt; quoted text In 2011, Musk estimated that fuel and oxidizer for the Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket cost a total of about $200,000.[156] The first stage uses 245,620 L (64,885 US gal) of liquid oxygen and 146,020 L (38,575 US gal) of RP-1 fuel,[157] while the second stage uses 28,000 L (7,300 US gal) of liquid oxygen and 17,000 L (4,600 US gal) of RP-1.

spacex,"For me, it really depends on the time of day, which launch pad will be used and what my goals are for the photos I hope to take away from that particular mission. For this one, I had one DSLR set for a wide shot, which was cropped to become the image you see here, while another DSLR was placed further back with a telephoto to capture an engine shot with more detail ([which you can view here](https://adambernsteinphotography.smugmug.com/Gallery/SpaceX-Falcon-9-ANASIS-II/)). 

While I love detailed engine/exhaust shots, I find there are fewer opportunities to frame the shot using visible elements and structures around the pad - which I prefer. It really comes down to personal preference. As far as combining the two elements, I prefer to work with what comes out of the camera rather than layer different exposures as a “single shot.” It’s more challenging to do so and always teaches me more about the process, making for a more valuable learning experience.",/r/spacex/comments/hv9m6x/remotes_are_back_from_the_pad_bringing_a_much/fyvke7u/

spacex,"I know the Saturn V 1st &amp; 2nd stages behaved that way, so it has some merit for that concept.

In the case of the Merlin engine, there are only two variants to simplify the manufacturing process: the lower stage engines and the vacuum engine for the upper stage.  Even then the only difference is the engine bell size and the mechanical links for gimbal movement.

This is important because Elon Musk wanted to treat rocket engine manufacturing like building automobiles and get similar benefits from reliability and cost.  This is a big deal when compared to most other rocket engines are ""hand crafted"" and have production numbers of just a few per year.  The Merlin engine at one point in time had as many as one engine being produced every day or more.

Some of that is giving way to Raptor engine production, which is going to have an even higher production rate eventually.  Still, if you think about it the most expensive part of any manufacturing process is tool set up and establishing logistical supplies to make the products.  This production line is really the unsung accomplishment of SpaceX that really makes the difference between them and other companies.  Many in the aerospace industry even thought it was a waste of money and even some were critical of SpaceX using the same basic engine for the upper stage as well.  It is neat in my opinion to see SpaceX laughing all the way to the bank from this decision too.",/r/spacex/comments/hv8zt0/falcon_9_riding_a_pillar_of_fire/fyvhofz/

spacex,"&gt;I'm hoping they added some control surfaces or something so they are literally flying them back down.

Yeah, imagine they're skydivers the size of greyhound busses. The parachutes are ram-air canopies, and can be steered (and, to an extent, slowed down) by pulling on control lines. Skydivers can consistently hit targets the size of a dinner plate with chutes like this. There's a little complication with the fairings because they want them to land straight down on the net instead of sliding to a stop.

So, I theorize that the boat and the fairing are negotiating an agreement. The boat announces that it will be traveling at a specific direction (i.e. into the wind) at a specific speed (i.e. a little greater than the fairing's minimum speed, accounting for wind speed). The fairing in turn announces when and where it would like the boat to be cruising at that heading and speed. Then the fairing gives adjusted target speeds and headings to the boat as it gets closer to the water, compensating for unknown winds at altitude. They should be in constant communication, sending their GPS locations and speeds back and forth. Ideally a highly spiffed up autopilot runs the boat's throttle and helm for this process.

Of course, there has to be an initial best guess of where the boat should start, based on the launch profile, so it has a chance of ""getting to the church on time"" after getting the first position report from the fairing.

This would be a fun thing to write the code for. At least as challenging as landing the first stage, since that trick only involves one moving vehicle.",/r/spacex/comments/huv6hu/elonmusk_on_twitter_both_fairing_halves_caught/fythmgi/
spacex,"Not to be too snarky but..
If I was them and I had billions to spend, I'd create such a large second stage that it wouldn't need fairings but instead would fly back for complete reuse.

As far as 2022 I doubt even Elon thinks that's possible. In that time they have to develop:
Lunar Starship (maybe)
Cargo Starship (the money maker for delivering Starlink)
Tanker Starship (to carry fuel to Orbit)
Mars Cargo Starship (for supplies)

But aside from that, SN5 and SN6 are almost identical, so successful tests of SN5 will remove any need to test SN6; that design is now obsolete. SN8 is being made from a new alloy using different welding methods (the same as they used for the SN7 test tank) and likely has many more improvements that are less clearly visible.

Basically what it boils down to is that SN6 tests are likely to be a waste of time; that time would be better spent testing the *current* system, as present in SN8, even if some of it has to be used putting SN8 together (which would need to be done anyway).

Many rockets, on ascent, are _purely_ steered by gimballing. The Falcon 9 also has its cold gas thrusters, but I think it only uses them when the engines aren't running?",/r/spacex/comments/hv8zt0/falcon_9_riding_a_pillar_of_fire/fysp4ni/

Waiting an extra year for serving that part of the world shouldn't be more than an inconvenience, but my point is that people living in Barrow, Alaska don't need to simply hope they eventually seem like a good idea.

They can have a rocket on SLC 39A and SLC 40 at the same time with no issues (as long as both aren't crewed as SLC 40 doesn't have any crew access facilities at the moment) but they don't have the ground support for two simultaneous launches. And there's not a situation in which they would absolutely have to do so either. If you're launching satellites to orbit the window is pretty flexible, why launch 2 at the same time when you can have 2 launches within a few days? There's also not a situation in which they would have to launch more than 4 astronauts to the ISS at the same time, hypothetically if they needed to put 4+ astronauts to the ISS the crew dragon is capable of up to 7, the ISS has a capacity of 6. In the event that the station needed to be evacuated they already have enough seats to get everyone home.

https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-elon-musk-wants-starship-spaceliners/

Article specifically references an Elon tweet dated May 30 2019   question was asked 

""Ah, so single-stage point-to-point? That sounds way better""

Elon Response:

""Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20.""

Also in some of his more recent tweets ( couldn't find quickly at the moment)  Elon has discussed special SS variants for E2E  with more engines to improve TWR and lower gravity losses for sub orbital E2E flights.

Edit:
 
Further down in same teslarati article:

Q: ""I guess the whole SSTO idea doesn't work because of lift off thrust. Raptor is powerful, but with a full propellant load Starship has a TWR under 1. It would need two more engines to have any shot at it.

Starship thrust is appropriately scaled for what it's supposed to do.""

I've still never seen a source for this. All official renderings for ETE *do* show a full-stack starship.

It's true that Starship is limited to suborbital if it plans to be reusable and/or to carry any payload, but I would think that a full load would prevent it from making most suborbital trips with any reusability.

Testing in 1962 showed that the paraglider was stable in free flight, but was heavier than expected (396 lb, twice the initial estimate). Gemini could only handle a 200 lb paraglider. Testing with 1/2 scale Gemini models was not very encouraging. High altitude test drops from 9800 ft early 1964 were not successful.

They got a whole bunch of very expensive Delta IV Heavy launches which SpaceX FH could have done  for a fraction of the cost. Reason being that if ULA does not get those contracts they close the production line for Delta.

My impression is still, SpaceX gets all the praise, ULA gets all the juicy contracts. Until this changes launch prices on average remain high. We will see if SpaceX gets the 60% contract which they should get. They are the only ones who have a certified launch fleet and they are cheaper. Also I expect even if ULA gets the 40% only they will get still paid more than SpaceX.",/r/spacex/comments/hmlcar/rspacex_discusses_july_2020_70/fyrmt01/

If an ecosystem is already very strong and healthy it can take the loss of species in stride. The problem is we've massively degraded the ecosystems surrounding us for decades and centuries. When an ecosystem is already on the brink the loss of one vital species can have cascading effects.

* Convert Webcast *ground speed* to m/s and to orbital speed (add 460): 7869.4 m/s  
* *Assume* we are at periapsis  
* Semi-axis is (Rpe + Rap)/2 (average of the radius at Pe and Ap)  
* Solve the [vis-visa equation](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2ef876b8914830177588da15dbc9e431464da9e) for Rap  
* I get 382 km  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  

To sanity check that result, let's use [a random point before SES-2](https://youtu.be/TshvZlQ7le8?t=2464)  
  
*  Webcast: 26601 km/h 181 km  
* Use previously calculated semi-axis (Rpe + Rap)/2 for a 164 x 382 orbit
* Compute the [vis-visa equation](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/b2ef876b8914830177588da15dbc9e431464da9e) for v given the radius at current point (181 km altitude)  
* I get an orbital speed of 7849.4 m/s which converts to a *Webcast speed* of 26601.7 km/h  
* That's close enough considering the Pe approximation and the webcast possibly scrambled telemetry",/r/spacex/comments/hu6sci/rspacex_anasisii_official_launch_discussion/fyr33xh/

I'm thinking about how the competitor can glean information about the architecture of the overall constellation architecture and its planned evolution.

Beam angles can be measured on the ground using a pair of ""tweaked"" ground stations.  Also, ping return times may be useful for an attempt to market a faster network than Starlink.

* How to intuitively understand orbits: Buy Kerbal Space Program, watch Scott Manley videos  
* Orbital theory: Read the wikipedia page on [orbit mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics) and [orbital elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements). Only consider Periapsis, Apoapsis and inclination as the others elements are irrelevant for energy calculations  
* How to compute an orbit based on speed and altitude at Apoapsis or Periapsis: Solve the [vis-visa equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics#Velocity) at the known position (Ap or Pe), the semi major axis contains the unknown (Ap/Pe Altitude). A reddit user made [this spreadsheet ^expires ^01/09/20](https://gofile.io/d/SckbGV) to compute GTO-xxxx values, but if you just play with each lines (See how E, F and G column change M and P columns), you will be able to see how it's done. I pre-filed it the published orbit for this launch.  
* How to guesstimate the orbit from webcast telemetry: Use the above and make assumptions such as SES-2 happening at roughly the final GTO orbit Pe altitude, speed being relative to surface (add earth rotational speed), SpaceX not fudging the numbers too much....  
* How to compute the GTO-xxxx value. Use the above on each of the burn points needed to reach GEO. For each, split speed in normal and tangential, add the burn components (normal and tangential) to get the new speed. The target orbit (GEO) is 35786 x 35786 x 0°.

spacex,"The re-entry burn always uses three engines, so does the boost back burn. However during these two burns, they ignite the centre engine first to stabilise the rocket, and then ignite two other engines, which due to the increased acceleration, reduces gravity losses. At the end of the burn the two outer engines shut down, and the centre engine ceeps running for a bit. This allows the trajectory to be fine tuned, and the orientation of the vehicle to be corrected, in case the outer engines do not shit down at exactly the same time. 
Droneship landings are usually also performed this way. One engine ignites, which ads a lot of control and stability, followed by the ignition of two more engines, which reduces gravity losses. The final landing is performed with only one engine, since it is easier to land with a lower thrust, since there is more time for corrections.
Land landings usually have higher margins (this is also the reason why they can afford the boost back burn), so a three engine landing burn isn't umdone very often.

GTO launches are the only ones that allow such a wide margin in the launch time.

I wrote a post just a day or 2 ago, detailing the burns involved in getting from the surface of the Earth to GTO, and then from GTO to GEO.  It shows that launches to GTO/GEO are about the least sensitive when it comes to the time of launch.

spacex,"The other answers missed some important points, so, ...

1. After separation, Elon has described each fairing half as, ""its own little spacecraft."" It has thrusters, gyros and enough guidance computer power to keep the outer portion of the fairing oriented into the wind, to provide the slight heat shielding needed, to slow the descent, and to prevent the fairing braking up when aerodynamic forces become significant.
2. Once aerodynamic forces become significant, it becomes possible to use the cold gas thrusters to steer the fairing halves toward the recovery ships. Looking at the shape of the fairings, my guess is that the L/D is higher than that of say, a Dragon capsule. My guess is that each fairing can steer 10 or 20 km while high in the atmosphere.
3. As the fairing gets lower, and slower, steering using the cold gas thrusters gradually stops working. At this point, a drogue chute must be deployed, followed by the parafoil. Parafoils are steerable, (by pulling on control strings) but they are so slow that jet stream winds are up to 20 times faster, so a successful catch is at the mercy of these winds, and accurate weather forecasts.

I am saving that.
Thanks.

Partly this is an engineering problem, partly this is just that the hydrolox exhaust is much, much lighter. This is great from an Isp standpoint because it leads to higher exhaust velocities and higher efficiency. But it's terrible for generating high thrust.

Some examples. Look at the space shuttle main engine (SSME, RS-25). One of the most expensive and advanced engines ever created. A full-flow staged combustion, regeneratively cooled LOX/LH2 engine. Each one generated about 2.3 MegaNewtons of thrust, with a sealevel exhaust velocity of 3.56 km/s, all from a beast of an engine that weighed 3.2 tonnes each. If you do the math, that thrust and exhaust velocity works out to a mass flow rate of 640 kg/s.

Now, compare that to a Merlin 1-D LOX/Kerosene engine. A gas-generator ""open cycle"" engine very similar in design to rocket engines built in the 1960s. Iteratively upgraded a lot to maximize performance, but still fundamentally limited in a few ways (it doesn't use staged combustion, for example). A sealevel exhaust velocity of just 2.75 km/s, just 77% of what the SSME was able to achieve. However, each engine weighs only 490 kg, and can pump out 845 kN of thrust. If you do the math, that's a mass flow rate of 306 kg/s, in an engine about 1/6th the mass of the SSME. With 6 Merlin 1-D's you can produce over twice the thrust of a single SSME for less total engine mass.

Some of this comes back to basic gas laws. Lower molecular weight exhaust leads to higher molecular speeds at equivalent temperatures, but it also leads to lower mass flow at equivalent pressures. But a lot of it comes down to propellant density. Go back to the SSME vs. Merlin 1-D's again. 6x Merlin 1-D's move 1800 liters/s of propellant, while 1x SSME moves 1900 liters/s of propellant, and they have equivalent engine weights, but the 6x Merlin 1-D's produce over twice as much total thrust.

Even if you scale things back to just 3x Merlin 1-D's where you have roughly equivalent rates of LOX usage you end up with the Merlin 1-D's pumping about 320 liters/s or 255 kg/s of Kerosene while the SSME is pumping a whopping 1280 liter/s of hydrogen but that's still only 91 kg/s. And the end result is that the 3x Merlin 1-D's produce more thrust with less than half the total engine mass of the SSME.

With Hydrogen you need big pipes and big turbopumps and that translates to heavier engines for the same thrust.",/r/spacex/comments/hu6sci/rspacex_anasisii_official_launch_discussion/fypvfov/

Honestly the biggest limiter of dual launches is actual launch facilities in close proximity, and little need at this point for the capability.

Blue Origin is not likely going to have a launch rate that will allow them to repeatedly test these recovery processes.

spacex,"&gt;Does/Will SpaceX have the operational capacity to handle same-day launches?

Right now spacex does not have the capacity for same day launches but the starship super heavy system including GSE is being designed with this in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What launch sites would be the most feasible for same-day launches? 

None of their existing sites would really be a good fit for multiple same day launches although this is really not a hardware problem but rather a range availability problem. Range control for more frequent launches was one of the original reasons listed for the development of the boca chica site back when it was intended to launch F9 and FH.   For high flight rates  spacex is investigating the use of ""floating launch complexes""  basically large platforms out at sea to launch and land rockets from in a safe environment where noise is much less of a concern.  They have already begun hiring engineers for this initiative.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Will boosters possibly be re-used for same-day launches? 

The intent is that yes the same booster is designed to be fly almost hourly if capacity dictates ( take this with a grain of salt,  F9 block 5 was supposed to be designed to re fly with a 24 hour turn around time and we are still a long way from that).  Note while the booster can RTLS within 15 minutes of launch the upper stage takes several hours due to orbital dynamics so the stated elon goal is that starships can fly up to three times a day ( again take this with a grain of salt)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Would this be the norm for orbital refueling? 

Yes the refueling will likely be the primary driver of higher flight rates early in the life cycle of Starship / Super Heavy.  It may take 7 or more tanker flights to top up a starship so high flight numbers are required.  This will be interesting to see as they will need it for their artemis program ""lunar starship""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What types of missions would benefit from multiple same-day launches? 

Refueling will definitely benefit from same day launches,  there is also the stated goal of earth to earth flight/transport using only starship,  this will likely start as an ultra high speed intercontinental delivery service and extend to passenger travel once / if sufficient safety levels are attained. This question is also a bit unknown at this point in addition to Refueling missions,  and E2E transport there is a bit of a ""If you build it they will come"" flavor to this system as well.  I don't think there is really a good understanding of what the need will be for a high capacity spaceflight at orders of magnitude below today's cost.   You could see daily or weekly trips to ISS,  you could see an explosion of commercial activity / space tourism.

spacex,"Maybe I'm thinking of the landing burn. 

Is it 3 for the re-entry burn and only 1 for landing?

The return-to-launch-site landing confused me for a long time because if you go up, then east, then west, then down... the down part is free obviously but you need to spend fuel to slow down and land gently. But to go west again you need to slow down then go back the way you came which sounds like an INSANE waste of fuel... until you remember by this point the rocket has shed almost all of its weight, in particular the second stage and payload plus most of its fuel. 
So a lighter rocket can go west again for a fraction of the fuel.

So is it 1-3-1 to slow to a stop, turn around and head west again, then it's only a single rocket for landing?",/r/spacex/comments/hmlcar/rspacex_discusses_july_2020_70/fypj5s7/

spacex,"In addition to what /u/eigenlaplace said, the ideal way to process HDR is to stack the images prior to converting them into a [display-referred](http://www.xdcam-user.com/2013/10/understanding-the-difference-between-display-referenced-and-scene-referenced/) format. Then do all the scene-referred edits and the final output conversion on the merged stack as a single image(ideally in floating point to preserve the range).

HDR photography isn't always done this way, sometimes it's manually compositing over several separate images, but that can lose data since you have multiple clip/rolloff points within the image instead of a single unified curve the way a sensor or film stock with sufficient dynamic range would have. Stacking prior to the output conversion preserves this workflow (Lightroom's built-in HDR features works this way, which is why it acts like a raw from a higher d-range sensor instead of the weirder HDR workflows you can end up with in other software)

EDIT: also, the SpaceX image is likely a stack of 2 totally different images, you can see the gradient above the top of the lightning tower where the overspill from the pad lights appears brighter in the sky than it does next to the rocket.",/r/spacex/comments/hupg2d/comet_neowise_over_falcon_9_and_anasisii_vertical/fyphxhc/

Thrust is equal to mass flow rate times exhaust velocity. Denser propellants are able to achieve a higher mass flow rate so they generally have higher thrust (though lower exhaust velocities).

You can see this with vehicles like Ariane 5, H-IIA, and the Shuttle, which use LOX/LH2 core stages but have to rely on solid rocket boosters for extra thrust during liftoff. Designing a LOX/LH2 engine with enough thrust to serve as a first stage engine is much more challenging than doing so with a LOX/Kerosene engine.

This idea seems feasible, but I wonder:

 - Does/Will SpaceX have the operational capacity to handle same-day launches?

 - What launch sites would be the most feasible for same-day launches?

 - Will boosters possibly be re-used for same-day launches?

 - Would this be the norm for orbital refueling?

 - What types of missions would benefit from multiple same-day launches?

However, there are other solutions other than ""yes, go for it, damn the consequences"" or ""no, shut it down, save the ecosystem"". I am Canadian, and for a long time we had an environmental policy of ""no net loss"", meaning that an industrial impact that results in a loss to the environment had to be offset by an equal enhancement to the environment (not necessarily in the same place, but as adjacent as possible). We have moved on from that policy to a ""net gain"" policy, ie if an industrial project is going to negatively impact an area's environment, then the company needs to enhance an area that would result in a gain to the overall ecosystem. Examples are artificial reefs, for example, or planting inter-tidal grasses and providing storm barriers so those areas are protected and can provide protection to juvenile fish.

spacex,"&gt;Dragon XL might actually have a larger interior volume

A 3m x 6.5m long cylinder is ~46m^3. For DragonXL to match that with just the main pressure vessel (so not counting the tunnel through the service module), it only has to be 4.3m long. It's hard to tell from the angle of the [official rendering](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NSF-2020-03-27-18-54-00-196-1170x716.jpg), but that doesn't seem unreasonable. Some fan [rendering/recreation](http://imgur.com/gallery/P9QL4CK) had it much longer than that. 

&gt;And that NASA might’ve been better off requesting a modified variant of Dragon XL

Eh. HALO got sole sourced in the interest of time. Even if SpaceX could have done better, it was NASA's opinion that this was the fastest. It's essentially a suped up node module, like, it was literally previously called the Minimal Habitation Module for a reason. It'll link the crew vehicle (Orion) to their extra supplies and room (DragonXL) and the lander (TBD). I think it's fine, and we're moving forward, and we didn't have to slog through a drawn out bidding process for a minimal node.

But you’re right, the upside is this will reduce the entry velocity of the rover into Mars atmosphere.  Whether they will continue to lower the orbit over the following months after orbit-insertion, to further lower the entry velocity, I don’t know.

But it’s been done both ways in the past.  The US Viking missions in the 1970’s inserted into Mars orbit before deploying the ~~rovers~~ landers.  The Soviet’s Mars 2 and Mars 3 spacecraft released the landers first.

(Viking landers went into orbit because they had no good imagery to choose a landing site; they needed the orbiters to do mapping first!)

If it's an orbiter, it's probably entering a high elliptical orbit and need to lower and circularize for science operations. Sometimes this is done via aerobraking, though I don't know in this case.

So if you have a lander on an orbiter, and have the dV budget to carry it into orbit (and/or don't want to try to separate for a direct entry, either due to guidance or mapping) you might as well carry the lander into a low orbit. You then have plenty of time to do checkouts and updates and whatnot as well.",/r/spacex/comments/hmlcar/rspacex_discusses_july_2020_70/fyob90n/

(figures might be out of date)
Technically: Falcon 9 (this version) has flown 68 times (wikipedia), 26 of which were reuse. The maximum reflight amount has been 5/6 times I believe. I'm aware that Starship has been designed bottom up to be 100% reusable and is a different beast but to go from this to flying hundreds of reuses on the same rocket with very little refurb if any is a huge challenge.

Lets say the technical challenges can be overcome and its safe enough to fly E2E you then have the enviromental factors, where is it going to fly to/from, airports struggle from noise regulations nevermind a rocket like Starship.

You then have legislation which will probably be the hardest/slowest part. Most rockets are launched off the coast heading over the ocean. You've got to convince goverment/legislatures that no one is going to have rocket debry land on their house (unless your china).

You could prepare an EIS for burning down a rain forest, document all the parade of horrible, and still decide that the need was there to destroy it; and NEPA would not stop you. At best, the environmentalist would pour through the EIS to find something you overlooked, and file to say ""Well, you didn't consider this part of it"", and seek to pause the action until that part was considered. The effects of choosing a poor environmental outcome are not legal, they're political. 

The Endangered Species Act is different, and requires an agency to refrain from taking adverse impact to a listed species. But even then, there is an exception written in which allows the ""God Squad"" at the Council of Environmental Quality (an Office of the President in the White House) to waive the requirements and essentially allow the species to go extinct, if needed for a national interest.

It's interesting to note that the Raptor engines actually heat fuel in the engine bell and use part of this fuel (prior to combustion) to repressurize the tanks (essentially heating them with combustion energy). See the ""tank pressurant"" pipes in this diagram

spacex,"To me the issue looks like heating of the tank walls during reentry. If the heat shield side of the tank gets to 600&amp;deg;C, while the lee side is at \~200&amp;deg;C, the whole frame of the Starship will look like a banana, and heat will be transported by the residual gasses inside the tanks, to the far side, which is good. But heated gas increases in pressure. You don't want the pressure in any tank to get so high that it bursts, You might have to vent residual gas to prevent bursting. You also might have to vent gas from the header tanks, although the thermal inertia of liquid fuel could keep the pressure down, for the minutes between the start of reentry, and the final landing burn.

After landing, as the rocket cools down, you get the opposite problem, which we saw with SN4, I think. If you have vented gas out during reentry to prevent overpressure, then after landing and cooling, he pressure in the tank might get too low, resulting in a crushed tank.

For the LOX tank, you could vent air into them, but for the methane tank, that's not a good idea. You would be making a giant fuel-air bomb. Better to use leftover methane from the methane header tank to adjust the main methane tank pressure.",/r/spacex/comments/hrt56a/starship_sn5_set_for_a_static_fire_followed/fylzj0o/

I think it is possible they will fly Starliner as copilots. There are many astronauts, and not many first flights to be had (or space flights of any description, at this time). Starship could change all that.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fylvp4c/

spacex,"It's a long time since I talked to Tito, and I don't remember whether he hinted to me that the Russian bureaucrats, who were not sophisticated about economics, had naively underestimated the total cost, or if this was a conclusion I came to, years later. Either way, I agree with you.

On the other hand, NASA and the ""old space,"" US contractors have often ""killed"" commercial space by overcharging. It is far smarter to spread the R&amp;D cost over 1000 launches, than to establish a price so high the R&amp;D costs are covered in 2 or 3 launches. In the later scenario, you will never get much commercial business, and so it becomes self-fulfilling.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fylul1v/

Arrival date (Mars Orbit Insertion) is Feb 2021. Lander/Rover EDL (Entry Decent and Landing) is NET April 23, 2021.

So obviously the Lander/Rover will spend about 2 months in orbit around Mars before the EDL.

spacex,"The way I see it, either:

1)  one or two legs would touch first, in a soft landing (then possibly land hard on the other legs as starship rotates after touchdown) or

2) or all legs will touch simultaneously and it would land with some lateral velocity.  If they rotate at the last second and and hard, then the lateral velocity could be small.  If they try to rotate slowly, the lateral velocity would be more (and it could slide, which I assume is undesirable).",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fylst12/

I assume it will basically balanced the whole time if they don't want the craft to fly off too far, so I imagine they won't be using this engine to control roll much if at all.  But I'm not paying a whole lot of attention to these individual missions, so I'm not sure what the goal is.

But early test flights using far fewer engines, for example three engines, would be much less of a problem, so could be conducted on the development site.

The ground station(s) for this beta test are apparently in Washington state, beta testers must be a single hop away since there are not yet laser links between satellites.

Added with an edit to better answer your question:  I'd guess 56 is pushing it, and someone that far north will only have continuous coverage when there are many more satellites.

**Note**: This will be the first webcast I'll be using [my new YouTube API based ""wait for start"" script](https://old.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/h8mold/starlink9_launch_campaign_thread/fx3o1h7/). I planned to use it on the Starlink 9 mission for the first time, but since that got scrubbed, ANASIS-II will now be the premiere. I worked out some kinks that ate up my daily API quota multiple times, but now it should be stable. I'll hopefully be around to watch how it behaves and intervene if anything goes wrong.

As usual, I will relay the SpaceX webcast via HTTPS and the audio stream via Shoutcast on my server, so people with no access to YouTube, experiencing laggy video or with low bandwidth connections are able to enjoy the webcast. If you don't like the web-based player, you can also use the M3U8 playlist in any [HLS-capable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) player - VLC is just one example. The playlist file will become available once the webcast starts, until then you will get a ""404 Not Found"" error. This is perfectly normal.

### Hosted Webcast (Video)

- Watch in your browser: https://codav.de/spacex.html
- Watch with a local player: https://codav.de/stream/spacex.m3u8

I will also provide audio-only streams of the webcasts in two different qualities. High quality (160 Kbps, stereo) for those who want more fidelity and have more bandwidth to spend, and a lower quality (64 Kbps, mono) stream for those on slow networks or with strict volume limits. If you require an even lower bitrate simply drop me a message, I'll add another stream then.

**Important**: The audio streams already loop the [Music for Space album](https://soundcloud.com/testshotstarfish/sets/music_for_space_tss) by /u/TestShotStarfish for your pleasure until the webcast starts, so don't confuse that with the actual webcast. Feel free to tune in at any time.

It looks as if SpaceX is happy to burn through as many flight articles as it likes, but is looking to limit loss of engines. Presumably, after half a dozen tests, they'll switch to three engines

&gt;  unlikely if an engine goes out you’d be able to save it by starting another engine.

In any case, a redundant engine has to be already running to be able to step in. Consider the several seconds of S2 cooling in and startup time on Falcon 9!

For future human rating, redundancy needs demonstrating from the outset. Just a random suggestion this, but do so without lengthening the critical path, they could be planning to fly a designated engine-redundancy test article, and work towards skydiver flight on another vehicle.

2) I think this could result in Starship sliding down the slope.  I'm guessing that is not ideal.
3) I think that may put a lot of force on the high leg (the one that lands last), as it would have to be at the last moment and would result in that leg bearing the brunt of the rotation in addition to the translation
4) Are they going to be firing one engine for landing when Starship is complete?  If so, they they probably want to keep the ballast wherever it best represents eventual Starship design.

1. Apply the resulting offset to the length of the legs.

True, but part of a Dragon's expected capabilities is to remain docked for extended durations (as much as two years I believe).  When and how does it qualify for that?  Do they just certify it for short missions and leave them up there for longer and longer periods?  Do they leave a sacrificial unit up there for a really long duration, and then bring it home for evaluation?

If the engine is truly offset from the CG, then I see no way around it.  If they expect the CG to be right on top of that engine, then that would work, but I doubt they plan that.

Seems to me that they would have to fire more than one engine to move the center of thrust right below the CG.  Either all 3 central engines, or one central engine and one high altitude engine (at lower thrust since it's father out).  Maybe that is their plan if Starship is heavier than falcon 9?

spacex,"Not much to discuss, it's already very well studied. 301 stainless has 0.15% carbon and 304L has 0.045% max. Higher carbon content is great for tensile strength because the tiny carbon atoms get into crystal structure dislocations and ""lock"" them together (imagine sliding two pieces of wood across each other, then add some sand and note how much harder it is to slide them.)

Since the grains can't slide relative to each other very well, you can stress the bulk material much further before plastic deformation. But the carbon content has a drawback because when you heat up 301 (as in a weld) you will see chromium attaching to the carbon in the molten metal and sort of falling out of solution as chromium carbide. Since your corrosion resistance comes  largely from the chromium, this means you're ending up with chromium depleted areas wherever you welded. Welds are often already weak points, but once you factor in advanced corrosion, they're gonna break.

304 is generally less prone to this carbide precipitation issue by virtue of having less carbon content (0.08%.) If that's not low enough for you, there's 304L at 0.045%. The 304s also have a higher nickel and chromium content, which makes them more expensive, but this offsets the lack of carbon a little bit. This makes it much easier to weld, too.",/r/spacex/comments/h9q0k1/elon_musk_on_twitter_tank_didnt_burst_but_leaked/fyjjz2v/

spacex,"I'm not 100% sure of this, but I think for geostationary launches, using the same launch time keeps all of the burns the same, going to geo transfer orbit.

It shouldn't be that hard to adjust things to get to the target orbit from any time of launch. Basically the plan always is:

1. Launch to LEO
2. Do a second stage burn as you cross the equator. That puts the apogee of the GTO (Geo Transfer Orbit) on the equator.
3. At apogee, the satellite is moving slowest, relative to the Earth. This is the best time to do a plane change. Depending on the mass of the satellite, the plane change burn can be done by the second stage, but for heavier satellites, it is normal for this burn to be done by a kick stage or onboard thrusters. The plane change can be done a little at a time, over several orbits, or all at once.
4. After plane change, the orbit gets circularized. This is usually done by onboard thrusters, and can use quite a bit of fuel.
5. Finally, to arrive at the correct longitude, the orbit can be left just a little high or low, so that the period is slightly more or less that 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.1 seconds. When the satellite gets to the target longitude, a very slight burn matches the orbit to the Earth's rotation.

There is nothing in the above that requires a launch to be at a particular time. You just want to miss the ISS, and any other satellites, so you time your launch to give good margins of safety.",/r/spacex/comments/htptvr/targeting_monday_july_20_for_falcon_9_launch_of/fyjjkcy/

Re-entry is always considered the most dangerous part of the trip.  They test the engines.  They have all sorts of abort procedures during launch.  They can escape from an exploding rocket.  They can burn a little longer if an engine fails to ignite.  

But they can't abort from a re-entry.  It's an all or nothing, one-way trip through fiery, intense heat, and there's not a single thing they can do about it if something decides to fail.

Thx for posting here!

&gt; I'm a huge SpaceX supporter

Had SpaceX handled relations with neighbors a little better (particularly as regards financial compensation), the support would be more general.  

I think the environmental impact should not be a ""for or against"" partisan issue. Objective questions need asking, such as noise impact on wildlife during launch. Clearly, Falcon 9 (for which the past studies were carried out) is not SuperHeavy. Consider its effects on birds. We may thus wonder about how its sound propagates underwater, and include its effects on fish.  There needs to be a Superheavy noise model that can be used anywhere else in the context of Earth-to-Earth destinations.

spacex,"While I generally agree with that sentiment, there is a BIT of a hand-waggle from me.

To use a completely unrealistic strawman example, what if we could permanently solve the world's energy crisis, but to do so involved destroying the protected last remaining nesting ground for some animal, effectively guaranteeing it goes extinct? Would the loss not be worth the advantage? Sure, we could try and shove the species into a conservation environment like a zoo, take DNA samples in the hopes of resurrecting them later, etc which would further reduce the ""loss"", but the core principal is ""Is it possible for the gain to humanity to be worth the loss to the natural world?"".

I think we can agree that there IS a line somewhere that as long as the boons are X good and the loss is only Y bad, then it would be crazy not to, it's only really a matter of where that line belongs.

spacex,"I'm one of those ""locals"". I'm 8 miles down Highway 4 from the beach (from the spaceport; same thing). Probably that biases my viewpoint.

I'm a huge SpaceX supporter - you won't find a more enthusiastic one. Most everyone I know around here is the same.

But access to that beach is really important to the people around here. I don't see any good reason to cut off public access to it (except during actual launches and static tests - that's fine, esp. if not on weekends or holidays).

There's an equally nice beach on the Mexican side, but that requires a 90 minute drive, and then re-crossing in to the US afterward, which can take hours (there's often a long line to get thru Customs).

There's a nice beach on South Padre Island - also over an hour away, each way (vs. 10 minutes).

The turtles have been there for ever - nobody (serious) ever proposed shutting down the beach for the turtles - that's just a rotten excuse. There are big signs saying to stay away from turtle nests (which people obey) and not to drive on the dunes (which most people obey - a little enforcement would go a long way).

SpaceX is important. Really important. But it's not the only thing that's important. The citizens of Brownsville shouldn't be made to suffer for SpaceX. 

It's not necessary, and it would only destroy the goodwill that people have for SpaceX.

We can share the beach.",/r/spacex/comments/hteqyq/faa_spacex_environmental_review_underway_to/fyhdhci/

spacex,"Not just human survival, either; the development of rocket technology to the extent it lowers launch costs and thus the cost of lofting entire ecosystems off the Earth's surface should be considered a very positive environmental impact. Assuming the will exists, rare and fragile ecosystems could be moved, expanded, or duplicated in isolated wilderness preserves in space habitats where they could easily remain completely unbothered by human activity, a feat impossible to accomplish for many ecosystems and species that inhabit locations very close to large human populations. These human populations themselves along with their industry could easily use the same technology to lift their industrial activities into space, reducing encroachment on the original environment.

Even better, lofting ecosystems into space would over time create enormous redundancy, where every species on Earth today could survive even if the entire planet was blown to bits.

You're thinking of ecosystems like a house of cards: take away one species and the rest comes crashing down. Well, they're not. Ecosystems are complex AND resilient systems at the same time. If one species dies out, ecosystems drive themselves back into equilibrium by increasing/decreasing populations of other species.

There is a minimum elevation below which they are not allowed to transmit to prevent interference with terrestrial users of those bands.

&gt;In fact, as you get further from the equator I would assume the antenna would point closer the equator (with 53 degrees being straight up).

They are also not allowed to transmit within a certain number of degrees of GEO to prevent interference with GEOsats.  This punches a big hole in the southern sky at higher latitudes.

They will probably want to point the boresight north halfway between the minimum permitted altitude and the northern edge of the protected GEO zone.  So somewhere near the north celestial pole. How close will depend on the relative widths of the exclusion zones I mentioned above.

[This document](https://llis.nasa.gov/lesson/759) states that the factory joints were different than the field joints, because they were continuously covered by asbestos/silica insulation, and perhaps were cast already assembled: the phrase ""continuous insulation and propellant strata over the factory joints"" (section 4) seems to imply that they connected the pairs of segments, insulated them, and then cast the propellant.  If they were assembled after casting just before shipping, the insulation/propellant wouldn't have been continuous.

So why not just skip the factory joint entirely?  I found some evidence that maybe they were manufactured in seven sections because of difficulty making steel cylinders large enough out of one piece of metal.  Some [design docs](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19920000825.pdf) for the in-development ASRM booster redesign imply that the case is near the limit of what they were able to forge at the time (p. 15), and welding was considered risky because it was hard to guarantee or detect a defect-free seam.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fygnhpy/

&gt;""[A]pplicants have the right to choose whether to conduct an Environmental Assessment (EA) under FAA oversight or work with the FAA to initiate the EIS process. If an applicant believes the proposed action would have no significant environmental impacts, or that they can mitigate any potential impacts, then the applicant typically chooses an EA,"" wrote Howard Searight, manager of the safety authorization division for the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST).

&gt;""However, all applicants run the potential risk that further review may uncover significant impacts that cannot be mitigated. In those cases, the FAA must conduct an EIS,"" Searight continued in his letter. ""SpaceX has begun an EA for the action of issuing experimental permits or launch licenses to SpaceX for Starship/Super Heavy launch operations at the Texas Launch Site.""

spacex,"Let's do some napkin math.

When they launch to the ISS, the launch time gets 24 minutes earlier every day, so that's probably how long it takes (23h 36 min) between times that it passes over the same place.

There are sixteen days between now and splashdown.  16 days x 24 minutes/day = 384 minutes = 6h 24 minutes.

Therefore, if they're splashing down around 3 p.m. EDT, it would be in the same node that the ISS will be at about 9:24 p.m. EDT today.

Looking at the [live tracking map](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/tracking_map.cfm) for the ISS's location, it looks like for both this past orbit and the upcoming one, the path over Florida and/or the Atlantic Ocean was the ascending node.

So, it looks like it's going to be on an ascending node when they re-enter.

The fact that it's happening mid-afternoon probably won't help matters in terms of visibility.  DM-1 re-entered about 2 hours after sunrise in March; this is entering in mid-afternoon in August.

spacex,"Starship can loiter in LEO for any length of time provided the altitude is sufficiently high to minimize atmospheric drag. The question is how much methalox propellant is lost per hour from those uninsulated main tanks due to boiloff  while loitering in LEO and how much boiloff loss can be tolerated without compromising the mission. 

So can Starship fly the Apollo 4 mission? That is, can Starship orbit the Earth twice (3 hours) to phase the trajectory correctly for a Boca Chica landing while losing propellant in the main tanks due to boiloff; then fire the Raptors for several minutes in a simulated TLI burn; then coast on an elliptical orbit with apogee around 20,000 km for 4.5 hours while losing more propellant due to boiloff; and then still have enough methalox propellant left after 7.5 hours of flight in the main tanks to do another several minute Raptor burn to increase the speed to 11.13 km/sec?

I don't know the answer since Elon has not shared any information on rate of boiloff from those uninsulated main propellant tanks. 

As I said before, I think Elon should send Starship on a free-return trajectory around the Moon to do this heat shield test. That would test the heat shield in a real lunar return flight, not in a simulated flight. This is what Starship is designed to do: refuel in LEO and then do the TLI burn fairly rapidly after (&lt;2 hours).

Well, the tunnel would have to be bigger than the stage, even if the wheels were at the ends and not underneath.

spacex,"&gt; The S-IVB hydrolox tanks were insulated so it could coast for several hours in LEO to phase the trajectory for that Pacific Ocean splashdown. And the Service Module uses storable hypergolic propellants .... Starship has methalox propellant in the header tanks but that is needed for the landing burns 

Wait, are you saying that Starship can’t loiter in LEO for a few hours, if it has any fuel in the main tanks?  Due to the heat radiating from the Earth in LEO?

Then how will refueling ops work?  Crew Dragon took 24 hours to rendezvous and dock with the space station.  Even Soyuz takes 6 hours.  Starship can probably dock with a tanker quicker than that.  But then you need time to actually transfer the fuel too.

I’m sure they can eventually speed up the process.  But at first, they’ll surely want to take it slow.  Maybe several aborted docking attempts before success.

spacex,"Oh, true, late night me forgot that's a thing.

On a side note, this got me wondering about whether or not the FH could feasibly lift the James Webb Space Telescope. The Ariane V's fairing diameter is 5.4m while the FH's is 5.2m, but the FH can throw roughly twice as much mass into GTO. It seems like the difference could be made up with a larger fairing without exceeding any structural limits or causing excess aerodynamic instability, but I'm not going to say that with any certainty.

I know putting a payload on a different rocket is a lot more than just matching up the volume and mass requirements, but if the Ariane V launcher that's supposed to send the JWST up is going to be retired in a few years, it might come to that. But then again, Starship would still probably be a better choice.

I learned some basic information about [SpaceX Dragon 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2#cite_note-10) from wikipedia. The Dragon 2 use x86 to control and PowerPC to actuation, i think those two types of CPU are both customized  for the Dragon 2. Can you explain something about the difference between the dedicated CPU and the ordinary CPU (both x86 and PowerPC)? Whether to include some special instruction sets that ordinary CPU does not have?  And when you are writing code, do you need to do something special to match the dedicated CPU?

As a programmer, I am very curious about flight control software.

Does the flight control software run in the ROM or does it run in the operating system?

If it run in the operating system,  Linux? or some other customized system?

Final question, I only know bit flip will cause program error, so there must be parity. Are there any other conditions that will cause the program to run incorrectly? if so, how to deal with it. I thought about this for a long time, but i can't think of other situations that might cause program error. But!

spacex,"&gt; If it doesn't get cancelled again last minute

I think what we've been seeing is them canceling the *road closures* at the last minute, not necessarily cancelling the *tests*. We can only see one of those two, and for a long time it seemed like they were closely correlated, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. In fact, I'd say that things seemed to change around the time they got their FAA permit back in May. 

We're not seeing them get set up for a test and cancel it, what it seems like is happening is they're booking road closures for anytime they might want to do a test, and then canceling them if they don't need them. And maybe they're getting a bit lazy or something and not canceling them until the last minute or they're keeping them ""just in case"" they want to move something?

Once we start to signs of activity of a test I wouldn't expect them to cancel it at the last minute. If they find a problem during testing, they'll probably stop the test at that point though.

spacex,"Right, so here's where it gets complicated. It really just depends on how much fuel you want to spend, and how much planning you do.

I've heard that about 3 or 4.5 hours is about the best reasonably possible, and 6 hours I think is the record so far, to get to the ISS. But it takes more fuel to do that.

So if the ISS isn't in an ideal spot, you're going to spend more time, and/or more fuel, in order to get to proper orbit.

Since fuel is expensive, and significantly more fuel is needed to launch that fuel to get into orbit, they tend to work with very thin margins and very little excess fuel.

So the full answer is really that with the amount of fuel loaded onto a falcon 9 for the purpose of getting to the ISS, and the cryogenically cold oxygen required, the launch windows are instantaneous. If you miss the window, there isn't enough fuel on board to get there in reasonable time, and even if there was, it'd be too warm after 35 minutes or so to be used.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fyd2d0s/

Granted, when starship has flown 20 or so times they might start with a static fire rather than cryo proof test.

spacex,"It's not so much where the ISS is in its orbital plane, but rather how that orbital plane sweeps around the earth (due to the earth's rotation). They want to launch when that plane crosses Cape Canaveral so the capsule's orbital plane lines up. They could probably afford the fuel to adjust the plane a few degrees either way (20 minutes earlier or later corresponds to 5 degrees of plane difference), but that's not enough leeway to detank and start over, so they just aim for the ideal moment.

If the ISS happens to be in the right spot in its orbit at the moment the plane sweeps over the Cape, then a short 6-hour rendezvous is possible. Otherwise the capsule spends longer in a lower orbit below the ISS until it can catch up.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fycxd54/
spacex,"Interesting points but I do have a couple counters:

""Test the SH landing sequence with 3 engines and a 20-100km hop before attempting landings with 20-30 engines""

I don't think we will ever see a 20-30 engine landing,  thrust levels would be way too high (dry mass of SH is thought to be in the 300t range) . Most engine configuration layouts with the current 31 engine booster indicate a center cluster of 7 engines.  The expectation is that the 7 engines or some subset of those 7 which gimble will be used for landing.   

Also when they manage to stick the 20km landing there really isn't much value in doing higher hops.  When they perform the flip / landing burn (SS) they will be at terminal velocity even when falling form 20kms  so there really isn't much difference if they are falling form 20km or 100km or any sub orbital altitude for that matter.  I am certainly no expert here but i would bet that once they stick the 20km landing the next milestone would be orbital.

We are also somewhat confusing the SS and SH here.  I don't think they need a SH for a 3 engine SS  20km hop + land.  The SH testing program will be interesting.  They aren't breaking nearly as much new ground with SH as they are with SS so we may see them do static fire followed by a launch attempt, with RTLS. If it works,  great if it does not it ends up in the ocean,  can't get much safer than that.

And a 2nd test stand far away from the first could alleviate the bottleneck in testing and reduce the impact of a RUD.  

And [u/Acadene](https://www.reddit.com/u/Acadene/)'s theory of this being for a crane isn't out of the question yet either (if not now, it might serve as the foundation for the future one).

Remember that the new test stand (for SN5) was already being built before SN4 retired the previous one, and insulated propellant piping already delivered.

The S-IVB stage inserted the spacecraft into a LEO parking orbit. After two revolutions in the parking orbit, the S-IVB stage was reignited for a simulated translunar injection (TLI) burn. The S-IVB was jettisoned and the SM engine was ignited for a short-duration burn to raise the apogee altitude to 9769 n. mi. (18,092 km). 

The CSM coasted for 4.5 hours in an attitude designed to thermally condition the CM ablative heat shield on the conical side of the spacecraft. The SM engine was reignited for a long duration burn and the CM and SM were separated. Atmospheric entry at 400,000 ft (122 km)  occurred with an inertial velocity of 36,629 ft/sec (11.16 km/sec) at a flight path angle of 6.93 degrees. Peak load factor was 7.27 g. The CM splashed down within 10 n. mi. (18.5 km) of the targeted landing point. This was the first recovery of the CM by parachute.

Maximum heat load was 120 kW/m^2. Maximum surface temperature approached 5000F (2760C, 3033 Kelvin).",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fyc4xfk/

spacex,"One of the pieces that makes it difficult to compare to existing hardware is the phased antenna array. The array is physically flat, which means the elements are likely dual-polarized patches. The FCC filings refer to circular polarization, which can be achieved on a dual linear polarized antenna by phase shifting one of the polarizations by 90°.

To achieve beam steerability with null cancelation, you need something like 8x8 dual polarized elements. Maybe you can sparsely populate the array and can get away with 48 different elements or so. The round antenna is probably comprised of a circularly truncated square array.

From here there are two options: independent, low-powered transmit/receive chains for each element and polarization with beam forming done by digitally controlling the phase shifts and amplitudes, OR split a high powered transmit/receive chain with power divider/combiners and perform the beam forming with RF attenuators and phase shifters.

Both of these options necessitate a lot of power on the front end because a lot of power is lost/used along the way. Yeah, in the end the effective EIRP will be something like a 5-10W average power transmitter, but you have to double that because of the polarization and I would guess 5-10x *that* for losses due to the phased array.

Edit: one other reason why I would guess that power range is because IEEE 802.3bt or some of the proprietary PoE standards (like LTPoE++) provide for 71-90W over a standard CAT5E cable to a powered device. Some proprietary standards can push it to 120W and I'm guessing that the engineers were lobbying hard for as much power as possible on the front end so they weren't as constrained on the other end.",/r/spacex/comments/hrlo9m/code_on_spacexs_starlink_website_contains_the/fybot6w/

Yes it was shipped in 4 sections, but at the manufacturing plant it originally started as 7 sections total. From what I could tell it seemed like it might have been a limitation in their ability to accurately cast the solid propellant in the desired shape on the scale that would have been required to do the whole booster at once. I don’t know whether it had to be done with each section vertically or not, but if it needed to be vertical then it would have required a rather tall building which may or may not have existed. Also the curing process for the solid fuel, I’m not sure on the actual limitations on how large of a casting you can do with it (I tried to find some kind of academic paper but was unsuccessful) but that could have added limitations to the size as well. Before the boosters left the manufacturing plant they would join 6 of the 7 sections in pairs and those joints also had the same O-rings that would later be used in the final assembly of the now 4 sections.

At the very least you need to obtain a permit.  So although I have no proof, I highly doubt that full-scale new assembled stages were tested to destruction.  B1022 that launched JCSAT-14 was very thoroughly tested with at least 8 full-duration static fires after it landed, but not to destruction.

The first three failures of Falcon 1 to reach orbit were well documented, although it was done from a small atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. After they mastered the orbit, and proved that the engines worked, they went straight to building Falcon 9 based on the same engines and bigger tanks made from the same material.

Of course they could have popped a couple of tanks (which I consider components), but I highly doubt there was a full stage static fire that ended with a kaboom, and all people of McGregor are still keeping collective silence about it.",/r/spacex/comments/hrt56a/starship_sn5_set_for_a_static_fire_followed/fy94pc0/

spacex,"Hard for me to believe there is any significant chance of the whole payload section being removable.   This would dramatically increase the complexity of the build.

Also don't forget the header tanks are in this section and that would add a lot of complexity as well.  Then factor in the complexity of making sure the heat shield mates up with no weak spots,  or damage during mating process and my head just starts to spin at all the possible failure modes this generates,  I would not want to be the engineer responsible for the FMEA on that system.

I definitely wouldn't discount the advantages of having this section removable but this whole idea seems to be counter to the whole ""keep it as simple as possible"" design philosophy for Starship,  as well as the "" if the schedule is long the design is wrong""  philosophy.",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fy93wr6/

spacex,"For Clarity, based on the userguide Bluezilla (Manitowoc 18000) when fully outfitted has a tip height of 189m (ie, you can add more sections to the boom and jib, and increase the counterweight), so height isn't the issue; it's what mass can it lift to what height as more sections lower the limits. 

At 130m tip height (85 degree boom angle) it looks like it could lift 125t.  At 140m 100t.  \*although there are numerous configurations and boom angles affecting peak mass, and these are listed as structural limits so I don't know if that includes tolerances (I'm assuming it does).

To add to this, we still haven't seen a nosecone stacked.  Some people have speculatively interpreted the Starship user guide as suggesting that the nosecone/fairing might be separate, this a 3rd stackable section.

There has been a lot of groundworks going involving geofabric and crushed rock in preparation of what eventually I surmise will be a concrete delivery and turnaround apron for SH and SS rolllifts.

For the Hexagon structure, it appears the sides are ground beams, and the nodes are angled pile reinforcement.  The pile reinforcement appears to have termination anchor disks, so that may be an indication of slab depth yet to be built.  I have a suspicion that a hexagonal Eiffel Tower like steel structure will go on top of this.  This steel structure will act as a pylon, and operate like a massive tower crane for integration of SS onto SH.  It will dwarf Bluezilla.  Eventually there will be a ramp up to this with possibly two flame diverters.

The only problem with this theory is that it is about as far as you can possibly get from the tank farm, unless the new deliveries of tanks are destined for here.

This may be one of EM's quick 'n' easy solutions to a launch site.  I don't think NASA is going to allow SS/SH anywhere near KSC until a fair few successful flights are demonstrated.

spacex,"Yes and no, but mostly no. Starship and Super Heavy are both variables with many shared properties: they have overlapping construction methodologies, propulsion, and what Super Heavy has to achieve is entirely dependent on what Starship ends up being.

Once they come close to finalizing the parameters for Starship, learn the manufacturing lessons they need to learn, and maybe also finalize and start mass-manufacturing Raptors, then they can start to zero in on Super Heavy's parameters and development.

I assume they're about to start attempting to try building and stacking larger versions of Starship's tanks for Super Heavy, hence the construction of the bigger high bay, and the start of construction of the new pad. I think that indicates they feel they've learned nearly enough about what materials the tanks will be made from, welding and finishing procedures, etc. and now they can start to learn lessons about what will emerge when they change the scale.

In any case, they can learn very important lessons with Starship faster, and with a lower materials cost, than they can learn them with Super Heavy, and since Starship is the most important variable in the equation (SH will exist mainly to launch SS), that's why it's getting fleshed out first. At this point, the bottleneck that we can observe seems mostly to be about them generally learning how to work with stainless steel construction, and some silly lessons about how to test more safely.

Now have hundreds of high profile verified accounts of the relevant party all 'responding' within a few minutes with messages that sound like they acknowledge his decision and/or have even spoken with him, blah blah.

Sure, within like, an hour, you'd have a proper full on press release declaring that the person hadn't actually withdrawn, but for that hour or so you'd have people voting with the understanding that their candidate has actually withdrawn, so they need to do a write-in candidate or whatever.

Something like this is going to be *incredibly* jurisdiction dependent. Worse, it's going to be incredibly dependent on what courts/countries decide they have jurisdiction and the laws of those jurisdictions that is basically impossible to predict.

Selling an exploit to someone that you *know* is going to use it illegally is probably illegal in most places under some form of conspiracy or aiding and abetting statute. What counts as sufficient belief that this is going to happen to count as ""knowing"" probably depends on jurisdiction.

Keep in mind you have to find buyers too. If you go on ""hackingforums.tld"" (made up site) and post ""I'll sell an exploit that will let you steal twitter accounts to scam people"" you're probably already reaching into the realm of conspiracy to commit a crime (in many jurisdictions). In order to prove to the buyer that you actually have an exploit (before they give you money) you probably have to hack twitter and therefore commit a crime (in many jurisdictions). And so on and so forth. Edit: You *probably* don't report that income, so you probably end up committing tax fraud, for another example.

* Automated internal monitoring: if there's a delay, then you can detect a spike in access resets for high-value accounts, and especially those where the account owner said ""that wasn't me"". Without the delay, the best you can do is mop up after it's already happened.

And although the darker pipe has indicated its use as a water spray function, with multiple spray attachments visible, the lighter coloured ss pipe does not show any appendages yet to indicate its function.  Those pipes have a few flange joints, which recently allowed a section of the pipes to be removed for better access to installing the raptor.",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fy79jcc/

In fact, as you get further from the equator I would assume the antenna would point closer the equator (with 53 degrees being straight up).

I have no idea what the capabilities of the Starlink antennae are (modern AESA radars can steer their beams 60 degrees off-boresight) but this picture would suggest a capability short of that.

The [potential rescue plan developed by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board](https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/02/the-audacious-rescue-plan-that-might-have-saved-space-shuttle-columbia/) required an extremely tight schedule with NASA only having about 26 days to finish prepping Atlantis for flight, roll Atlantis to the pad, launch Atlantis, and rescue the crew of Columbia. This is less than half the record set in the 80s before the Challenger disaster when NASA was doing much more frequent flights.

So, even if they'd realized there was an option to possibly rescue Columbia's crew, the odds were long and they'd have to put four more astronauts at risk on a much riskier launch. At that point, if they decide it's not worth the risk, what would the point have been?

If you don't have a rescue plan in place, is there a point in even assessing the danger? What are you going to do if you find out the crew will be killed? If you come up with the long shot rescue plan and choose to risk 4 more astronauts, what do you do when you can't make the deadline?

This is getting more and more confusing. My comment was about what standard you were talking about as you didnt disclose it for the 100-200 figure.

The 100-200 was my understanding it was MBytes pr sec as it is unrealistically it was in Mbites as I tried to show with the bites to Bytes conversion.

If they are in raid 6 they should be able to do much much more. 

Anyways. My comment was about that I think your 50-60 figure is in Mbits, and the other figure (100-200) is in MBytes as you discribe you think its the harddrives that are the bottlenect. And it cannot be Mbits as 12.5-25MBytes (the conversion I showed) is not realistic speed for a harddrive. Its too slow. So it must be 100-200 MBytes you mean. Which would fit with it being a wired connection. 

So its much much much faster. 60Mbps is like 5MB/s... vs the 100MB/s.

There are several people who have claimed to pay this amount, as well as people who have provided additional photos of their bills per month to Rogers and Bell. Just because you do not pay this amount, does not mean nobody else does. It does happen, and it makes perfect sense why it happens.

Rural areas are still imposed by data caps of between 150GB/250GB or more a month, and those who work from home often go over it frequently because they have to do video conferences and such. Some can’t even use their internet and their “tries” to use it result in significant data throttles, and even more cost to the consumer.

With rural areas that have data caps, they are often charged a certain price per MB/GB. Depending on their usage, it can amount to hundreds of dollars. Different areas have different provisions.

I would invite you to take a look at the CRTC BITS interventions and read about the issues many, many people in rural Canadian areas have, and form your own conclusions based on the stories of people who live in rural areas, and how they are paying significantly more for service they have been promised decades ago be the big three.",/r/spacex/comments/hqx1dj/the_starlink_team_is_now_accepting_addresses_for/fy2ogxw/

spacex,"I wonder how the acoustics of Starship launch and landing might affect the logistics of E2E?

In the Apollo program, they were worried that the Vehicle Assembly Building might be [damaged by acoustic energy from Saturn V launches](https://www.popsci.com/how-big-rockets-break-apart-buildings/) even though the VAB was 3 miles away; they engineered the VAB to be able to withstand this. Starship/SuperHeavy launches are expected to produce peak sound pressure levels in excess of 140 db at the launch site. (See Appendix A Figure 12 in the [environmental impact assessment](https://netspublic.grc.nasa.gov/main/20190801_Final_DRAFT_EA_SpaceX_Starship.pdf).)

I imagine that this (and other safety considerations) would mean that all ground personnel would need to be evacuated (and at a safe distance) before a Starship can be launched. If ground personnel are needed to assist with boarding and cargo loading, then this would potentially affect the overall time from passenger arrival to launch. So, in addition to considering how passengers will be transported to the launch site, perhaps one should also ask how ground personnel will be quickly evacuated from the launch site?

I wonder, too, if some types of transport craft will be vulnerable to damage from acoustic vibrations, so that (even if they could be autonomously piloted) they too will need to be a safe distance away before a launch occurs? Might this affect the choice of transportation mode to/from the launch site? Would air transport or boats be better from this perspective? I'm guessing boats would be more able to withstand high acoustic energy levels (unless the low frequencies are more resonant with their greater size)? But boats would have a harder time quickly getting to a safe distance? How might this affect the total time to load passengers and prepare to launch?",/r/spacex/comments/hn7rk0/the_starship_e2e_launch_site_commute/fy27t7c/

spacex,"&gt;It’s true there may be test articles that are not orbit worthy, but without a final payload fairing and other hardware, will the aerodynamic data still be applicable enough to cover the cost of 3-6 engines?

The shape and size are accurate. The clamshell opening or viewport are what are still very much uncertain.

&gt;Everything SpaceX does needs to be self funding as rapidly as possible in order for economy of scale to kick in.

They're already pretty much there. The Block 5 Falcon 9 and their lunar lander contract are already significant revenue sources. Sure they'd make a higher margin from orbital Starship launches, but potential for failure upon launch, ascent, or orbital insertion is a real and very unpleasant thing. People won't fly any payloads on Starship (even Spacex won't) until it has made orbit successfully at least once.

And we still haven't seen a SuperHeavy stacked, let alone off the ground. Hops are what we have in the present. Increasingly high hops get data.

&gt;Therefore, the fastest path to potentially-destructive landing tests being “free” is to get orbital.

Don't get me wrong; I 100% agree with you here. The problem though is that every process has bottlenecks and this one has *many*. You can't let those bottlenecks slow you down. You know how long it's taken just to get a hop from SS itself, yet SpaceX keeps iterating on their design anyway, changing welding methods and Stainless Steel types etc.

Remember this; Mk 1 could have flown. It wouldn't have had a safety margin but they still could have stuck a raptor on it and put it up in the air. But they destroyed it on the ground because what they needed to learn in the moment wasn't necessarily what was on the closest path to a full orbital trajectory. Sometimes that is just the case, unfortunately.",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fy23aar/

Part of the qualification phase of the contract for SpaceX was three specific qualification flights.  Demo-1 was an uncrewed flight of the vehicle.  IFA was a abort test using flight hardware.  Demo-2 was a final test flight that would be crewed.  Originally, Demo-2 was only supposed to be a short duration mission (just a few days), but NASA opted to upgrade it to a longer duration mission.

So, you'll need to be within 470.35km (292.26mi) of a ground station.

&gt; Does that relatively close proximity make me more/less/irrelevant to SpaceX as far as inclusion in the beta?

Unknown.

Starlink is in the unique situation in that they can bring up and fine-tune their network on a Ground Station by Ground Station basis. Simply by only signing up subscribers (sending out User Terminals) by address as they want to increase the load on a given GS. So, at any particular GS they could start out with, say, 10 transceivers, sign up a certain number of subscribers in the area, fine-tune their equipment, install more transceivers, add more subscribers, fine-tune, rinse &amp; repeat.

Just a wild, wild guess, but I figure they might start out signing people up in relatively close proximity to a given GS and work their way outward. That would give them the strongest signal strengths with which to get things grooved in.",/r/spacex/comments/hqx1dj/the_starlink_team_is_now_accepting_addresses_for/fy1qcvm/
spacex,"It’s true there may be test articles that are not orbit worthy, but without a final payload fairing and other hardware, will the aerodynamic data still be applicable enough to cover the cost of 3-6 engines?

I can’t answer that, but if it is, then go for it.  Maybe they already have the engines in such high numbers, or can build them so quickly and cheaply, that they can afford to lose them for this purpose.

Otherwise, there are useful pauses in a project like this. Being able to iterate rapidly means you can also afford to spend time considering alternatives and analyzing the test data.

Something else worth considering: every Starlink launch costs SpaceX some millions of dollars (one F9 second stage with mvac, an F9 booster flight, and possibly a fairing or two).  By getting orbital, each Starship test flight can save SpaceX multiple F9 launches in money.

If it costs $10m to launch 60 Starlink satellites on F9, and a single Starship launch can put 4 times as many satellites in orbit (conservatively), that’s $40m in funding that can be used for Starship instead.

Everything SpaceX does needs to be self funding as rapidly as possible in order for economy of scale to kick in.

Getting reusable orbital class ships perfected and produced in volume is going to be obscenely expensive, and SpaceX has already told us that Starlink would fund Mars.  The fastest path to generating revenue is getting Starship orbital.  Therefore, the fastest path to potentially-destructive landing tests being “free” is to get orbital.

Never stop pulling on the bootstrap of finance, and you can do anything within the laws of physics.  Starlink revenue is the bootstrap that pulls high volume interplanetary travel out of our dreams and into the real world.  Boca Chica isn’t a field of dreams, it’s the gateway to Mars.",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fy1qcca/

spacex,"Similar estimates have been made for every other satellite constellation too. 

Bankruptcy is rather a running theme for telecom constellations. Iridium? Bankrupt. Globalstar? Bankrupt. Orbcomm? Bankrupt. And now OneWeb? Bankrupt. They require a massive up-front capital outlay and a long payoff, so are very vulnerable to whoever has a controlling interest getting cold feet and bailing. Starlink has two things going for it here: a *reduced* capital outlay (still massive, but launches are cheaper but more numberous, and the satellites are supposedly cheaper though there are intended to be an order of magnitude more), and what appears to be no way for external investors to pull out. On the flipside though, Musk has effective control, and Musk's goal is colonisation of Mars, not satellite broadband. Starlink exists to be wildly profitable quickly, to fund SpaceX R&amp;D for Mars. If Starlink is merely looking like its going to be about-break-even over a long timescale, it may get killed of simply as a waste of resources.",/r/spacex/comments/hos9xp/what_onewebs_1_billion_rescue_from_bankruptcy/fy1bxfn/

Cities could have significant demand, but Starlink capacity in high density areas will be limited. Rather than just not covering cities at all, it's likely that prices for those areas will simply be increased until the demand matches available capacity.

For Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (that makes the H-IIA), space launch vehicles are just a small part of their business. As for UAE, the fact that it's a Mars mission is quite exciting, but isn't revolutionary in any way. It's a probe, it will orbit Mars and collect some data about the atmosphere for 2 years.

There is certainly a difference in the amount of resources focused on this development in the early 2010s for starship and SLS, as SpaceX main focus in this period was the Falcon 9.

spacex,"&gt; That said, I would be truly disheartened if we never get to see an SLS  fly, even if only unmanned. They’re so close that the remaining steps  seem worth the spectacle. 

I agree, complete the hardware that is already in the construction process (around 1-4 SLS launches). However, scrap everything beyond that as it binds far too many resources in the long term. At $2 billion per launch (omitting the payload costs) a launch cadence of one per year might be the maximum. That's not enough.

&gt; Taking those incredibly expensive components and expending them seems like a baffling decision. 

I can get the initial thinking. Ares was scraped, the US had no manned LEO access on its own for years to come, and there was no serious beyond LEO rocket on the horizon when the decisions to build SLS were made (SpaceX had far-out plans but the first Falcon 9 was not even launched, the market for commercial launch procurements was in its infancy.). The idea to cobble together a rocket cheaply and fastly from existing hardware like LEGO seemed tempting. However, rocketry is not like LEGO.

* Planned tests that are delayed for whatever reason
* Testing that isn't planned but a possibility if supply chain and production cooperates
* SpaceX trying to establish a regular testing/closure cadence
* Attempting to reduce hwy 4 and public beach usage so residents will choose a different location, making a permanent closure easier to achieve

It can be done, but what’s the advantage if you otherwise have a functioning Super Heavy?  Go to orbit, drop off a payload, try to land near-ish your launch site, iterate until you can rapidly reuse.

If you land thousands of miles away from the build site, it will require that much more time for the engineers and builders to study the recovered vehicles in order to reach reusable mass production.

2) Two independent vehicles meaning two independent timelines that have to both be in sync.  I assume that would mean two sets of controllers on the ground as well, which isn't impossible.
3) Whatever caps and lims the range has as far as tracking and communication bandwidth.

With the FH, AFAIK, it was one vehicle from one pad, with one ground support and mission control team, although each core was able to successfully navigate its way through landing.

The weak companies die, the strong companies thrive so over the long term everything works itself out.

Its quite clear that as a business, OneWeb did not have the managerial team or resources necessary to succeed. Even technologically, their solution is less viable than competition who have their own rockets, have more financial resources. OnceWeb are launching sats that cost millions that are less capable than each Starlink satellite that costs £250k. On a commercial basis this should not succeed as there are lower cost - better alternatives available.  

This is pure manipulation, its called a UK company but the only thing UK about it is that they have a building somewhere in the UK call HQ. The boss and founder is american, all the technology is built in America. They did this for political reasons, because they thought being known as a UK company as opposed to an American company would help them gain licenses in more markets. The fact they tried to buy specturm and then block anyone else from operating. These are all scummy business tactics.  

By a government entity essentially stepping in (for various reasons) this essentially defines it as something too important to fail. No matter how poor performance, no matter how expensive, because its strategically important to a government, they will pump whatever resources into it that are required to keep it going. That means our tax money is being committed to keep this turd alive.

Whats the incentive to actually develop a better services than your competition when you will be funded regardless.

At the end of the day, its all legal and these entities are entitled to take the risk. However, the UK governments and Indian governments will now have special interest in OneWeb as a service provider. Those are some key potential markets for Starlink which may now not be able to obtain the market share needed to succeed because these government entities will require that a certain amount of the business use there domestic systems. 

If Starlink succeeds so much in UK and India that it puts OneWeb out of business, that is the natural way.

We do have lots of suggestions from Elon that it will have a dry weigh of ~150 tonnes perhaps going down to 120 eventually and a payload of ~150 tonnes to LEO.

Assuming all 150tonnes lifted to LEO is all propellant this gives a deltav of less than 2.5km/s, so without refuelling and with no actual payload starship couldn't quite get to GTO and then it would be left there. (Getting back with Starship wouldn't need as much deltav as aerocapture is a possibility, but it would still need some and or lots of time). It's actually much worse than that as the mass being move around needs the landing fuel adding so for the purposes of calculating deltav these numbers are overly optimistic.

But not a big thing. The important thing for laymen to understand is that one degree Kelvin is equal in value to one degree Celsius.

Heat generated is minimal

Radiative heat absorbed is the sun's radiation, earth's albedo, moon... v quantity and quality of surface body (starship is anti black body). Even that is close to freezing.

Radiative heat emanated is the quantity and quality at temperature pointed at something not the sun or earth or moon... ,  the fact that the surface is round, shiny and conducts heat from hot to cold maximizes the vehicles heat emittance.

spacex,"&gt;Let me walk it back a little, I guess. Any craft going to the moon and especially Mars would have to be purpose built, and there's no need to make it conform to starship's design

Is it because it's the old/traditional way, and that's how it must be done?

Purpose built, but expensive because its potential is limited? Meh

Starship will have many variants, is that not purpose-built enough? But the fact that it's conform to the core common design is **very good** because there's **no additional expensive development costs &amp; time**

It's this attitude that make spaceflight progress stagnated (many generations wasted, many Apollo people died, Flat-Earth conspiracy rise, etc.). We're in revolution now

SpaceX build Starship for that reason, to land on celestial bodies, whatever how loud you would scream. It's SpaceX product not yours

spacex,"The tanks store a sub cooled liquid rather than a gas. So the flight pressure in the tanks bears no relationship to the quantity of propellant that can be stored since the liquid is virtually incompressible.  

The tank pressure is regulated to a constant gauge pressure so the pressure above ambient pressure rather than a constant absolute pressure. Therefore the structural loads on the tank are the same at sea level as they are in space.  

The ullage pressure is also dynamically unstable with autogenous pressurisation so as soon as the engine burn stops there will be no supply of hot gas to the tanks and the gas will condense onto the surface of the liquid propellant.  The ullage pressure in the tanks will drop to very low values of 0.1 bar or less within a period of several minutes.",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fxvk5zi/

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX ANASIS-II Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shahar603, your launch host for this mission[.](https://airbus-h.assetsadobe2.com/is/image/content/dam/products-and-solutions/space/telecommunication/eurostar/ANASIS-II_shipment_Copyright_Airbus.jpg?wid=1920&amp;fit=fit,1&amp;qlt=85,0)

## Overview

ANASIS-II is a South Korean military communications satellite, built by Airbus Defense and Space and operated by South Korea's Agency for Defense Development. Based on the Eurostar-3000 platform the satellite will operate in geostationary orbit and provide wide coverage over the Korean Peninsula. A Falcon 9 rocket will deliver the spacecraft to a geostationary transfer orbit and the booster will land on a drone ship downrange.

Per the customer's request, live coverage will end shortly after first stage landing.

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX GPS III SV03 (Columbus) Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

Hello everybody, I am u/Marc020202, and it has been a while since I hosted the last thread!

**Mission Overview** 

This mission launches the third GPS III satellite into orbit and is the second GPS launch for SpaceX. Although the GPS III SV01 launch aboard Falcon 9 expended the booster, this mission's booster will be recovered via ASDS landing. The destination orbit, however, is unchanged. SpaceX is also planning to launch at least 3 further GPS III missions.

# Primary Mission: Deployment of payload into the correct orbit

Since the press kit for this Mission has not been released yet, it is not 100% clear how the mission will be executed, however, it is likely that like the GPS SV1 mission back in 2018 the Second stage will target a parking orbit first, before Igniting the Merlin Vacuum engine again, boosting the satellite into a 20200km by 1200km Orbit with an inclination of 55°. The first stage engine burn will likely be a bit shorter to save fuel to allow B1060 to reenter and land.

Check recent comments for real time updates.

At the start of thread #12 Starship SN5 has just moved to the launch site and is preparing for testing. Starship SN6 consists of a fully stacked propulsion section at the assembly site. Starship test articles are expected to make several suborbital hops in the coming months beginning with a 150 meter hop and progressing toward a 20 km hop. Orbital flight requires the SuperHeavy booster, for which [a new high bay is soon to be erected](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1269418186757206016 'Tweet by @elonmusk'). SpaceX continues to focus heavily on development of its Starship production line in Boca Chica, TX.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starhip development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

spacex,"#[We're pleased to announce, Dr. Robert Zubrin will be returning to r/SpaceX for another AMA next Saturday in conjunction with The Mars Society.](https://i.imgur.com/QBmST0K.png)

While I'm sure that Dr. Zubrin needs no introduction for most of us here, for those of you who are new, [Dr. Zubrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zubrin) is of course the Mars Society President and one of the founders since 1998. Earth's most famous and passionate advocate for Mars, backing that energy with serious engineering knowledge, working on hundreds of space exploration and nuclear tech research papers, including the famous [Mars Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct) mission! He has also authored or co-authored over a dozen books, just last year publishing [The Case for Space](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HDSSKHJ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0). (My favourite is [The Case for Mars](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Mars-Plan-Settle-Planet/dp/145160811X), but I highly recommend both books.) Not to mention literally hundreds of interviews on the subject (many available on youtube). Zubrin has spent his considerable talents towards figuring out exactly how to get to Mars for decades; With SpaceX being created with nearly the sole purpose of getting humanity to Mars, there is a deep shared purpose, with Dr. Zubrin keenly watching SpaceX from the start with as much interest as any of us, even helping shape Musk's passion for Mars as a destination.

With more than a week until the AMA, I recommend checking out [last year's AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/e0kqpk/im_robert_zubrin_ama_noon_pacific_today/) which was a wealth of information. Of course, any of his books are highly recommended. More recently, there is [this 2 parter interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwdipsDsQYs) directly about SpaceX, Musk and how they change our path to Mars. Recently Zubrin has also penned numerous [articles](https://spacenews.com/op-ed-toward-a-coherent-artemis-plan/) analyzing the lunar [Artemis plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program) which SpaceX has recently become a part of with Dragon XL and Starship HLS contracts in the early stages. Dr. Zubrin also spoke with Musk at Boca Chica as recently as February and wrote about that [here](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/02/mars-elon-musk-plan-to-settle-red-planet/?fbclid=IwAR3HY65gnvLUZQsOdAkksEF4PCF1Aql3VJflaIAugd2C6inFdG8lDdP7RbM). While a week is not enough to read a fraction of Dr. Zubrin's work, I hope most of you will check some of it out prior to the AMA, it is inspiring stuff!

Looking forward to another solid AMA!

-----

Special thanks to Edward Heisler and Lucinda Offer of The Mars Society ( https://www.marssociety.org/ ) for helping put together this AMA. You can get involved without ever leaving reddit on r/MarsSociety . They also have their [**23rd** annual international convention](https://www.marssociety.org/conventions/2020/) happening on Oct 15~18 which is online this year and free to join, a good chance to further get involved in getting our asses to Mars.",/r/spacex/comments/hbk3ob/how_to_get_to_mars_dr_zubrin_ama_saturday_27th/

#Starlink-9 (STARLINK V1.0-L9)

## Overview

The tenth Starlink launch overall and the ninth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy 58-60 Starlink satellites into an elliptical orbit roughly 25 minutes into the flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. This mission includes the second rideshare on a Starlink mission, with [two of BlackSky's satellites on top of the Starlink stack](https://spacenews.com/blacksky-launching-two-satellites-on-june-starlink-mission/). The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 632 km downrange.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather, and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

spacex,"What an awesome launch, just like always! As I was reading the stats about everything, this launch seemed especially interesting from a financial perspective. The new elements (ride-share with Skysat and foregoing a static fire) stand out to me as not just technically interesting, but also potentially financially interesting:

1. Skysat is a paying customer. It's well-known that SpaceX's internal costs for launching boosters are likely well-below what they charge commercial customers...but it still does cost them money. By dropping 2 Starlink satellites and making room for a few Skysat ride-shares, they're now lowering their own internal launch costs. I have no idea by how much, Skysat just said they got a ""good deal"", so I'm guessing that's probably somewhere between $1-5 million.

2. No static fire test. While this seems like just an efficiency boost (which it is), it's also a non-zero cost. The have to get their crew onsite, they likely have to pay to get NASA/FAA people onsite, they have to fuel the vehicle, pay for cryogenics, etc. This all seems trivial, and when you have a rocket launching for $150 million it is; but when you have a rocket that can be launched multiple times, decreasing its per-launch price each time it goes up, you have to start looking for financial savings elsewhere.

SpaceX appears to just really aggressively to be looking for any way to (safely) cut cost-per-flight down. This is similar to catching their fairings, which are a rounding-error on expendable launches, but actually do start to add up when you're reusing your rockets.

All this to say, this is why I think SpaceX is so much better positioned to build something like Starlink, and why I really don't think there will ever be other competitors. They already have 500+ satellites in orbit when their next closest competitor just declared bankruptcy, and the next closest after that just issues press-releases about their plans and performs one sub-orbital flight every year. Meanwhile, SpaceX is aggressively getting their launch costs down and putting 100+ satellites in orbit per month.",/r/spacex/comments/h8ah79/starlink_the_ocho_launch_seems_to_be_really/

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 8 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shaha603, your host for this mission[.](https://i.redd.it/ck3ipxff9c451.png)

**Mission Overview**

The ninth Starlink launch overall and the eighth operational batch† of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy 58 satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. Riding along are 3 SkySat satellites launched for planet labs. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.
Half of Falcon 9’s fairing previously flew on the JCSAT-18/Kacific1 mission, and the other half previously flew on SpaceX’s third Starlink mission. 

† The first Starlink mission launched a batch of prototype satellites that do not form part of the operational constellation.

spacex,"Potentially huge good news for Starlink:

1. FCC will hold an auction in October 29 to award $16B subsidy over 10 years for building up broadband infrastructure for rural America.

2. The auction has two latency tiers high and low, the low latency tier requires latency to be less than 100ms, and vendors in this tier will have a big advantage in auction.

3. SpaceX has been arguing Starlink can meet this latency threshold, but since they (and all the other LEO constellation) are not in commercial service yet, there're proposals to forbid them from bidding on low latency tier at all.

4. Less than a months ago, FCC released a document stating LEO constellation is not allowed to bid on the low latency tier, this would make it difficult for Starlink to get significant amount of subsidy from this program.

5. Today FCC took a vote on whether to go ahead with the auction, it looks like just before the vote they changed their stands on the issue and now allows LEO constellation like Starlink to bid on low latency tier.

6. In order to get the subsidy, Starlink still need to prove its latency to FCC's satisfaction and will need to face off the other broadband providers in the auction, but this could potentially allow Starlink to get significant amount of subsidy (i.e. multiple of billions) from this program, it could be a huge boost for Starlink and Starship in terms of funding.

    &gt; And, at the request of one of my fellow commissioners, **we also don’t entirely close the door on low earth orbit satellite providers bidding in the low-latency tier.** However, it is also important to keep in mind the following point: The purpose of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is to ensure that Americans have access to broadband, no matter where they live. It is not a technology incubator to fund untested technologies. And we will not allow taxpayer funding to be wasted. A new technology may sound good in theory and look great on paper. But this multi-billion-dollar broadband program will require “t”s to be crossed—not fingers. So any such application will be given very close scrutiny.

2. [Commissioner Michael O'Rielly's statement](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/060962555534/DOC-364811A3.pdf):

    &gt; **I am grateful to the Chairman for agreeing to expand eligibility for the low-latency performance tier and change language that was prejudicial to certain providers.** While a technology neutral policy across the board may have been more effective in promoting innovation and maximizing the value of ratepayer investments, I recognize that a balancing act was necessary to reach the current disposition. I also thank the Chairman for agreeing to clarify that the Commission will re-evaluate the eligibility conditions prior to moving forward with the second phase of the auction. Communications technology evolves at an extremely rapid pace, and who knows which technologies will have advanced or emerged by the time we get to Phase II?

3. [Commissioner Geoffrey Starks's statement](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/060962555534/DOC-364811A6.pdf):

    &gt; The ten-year term the Commission chose in January has additional ramifications for this Public Notice. Committing so much of the budget for so long raises the stakes on how we treat emerging technologies and technical capabilities. **I appreciate Commissioner O’Rielly’s work in revising this Public Notice to eliminate the categorical bar on low earth orbit satellite systems bidding in the lowlatency tier, especially now that we have evidence in the record that those systems can meet the 100-millisecond latency standard.** At the same time, I see no need for the Public Notice’s predictive judgments about the merits of short-form applications from low earth orbit satellite operators. As I have stated previously, **next-generation satellite broadband holds tremendous technological promise for addressing the digital divide and is led by strong American companies with a lengthy record of success.** Commission staff should evaluate those applications on their own merits.

4. Possible reason for FCC's change of mind, [found by u/softwaresaur](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/gzszn0/the_proposal_also_will_allow_low_earth_orbit/ftjjlh8/): [SpaceX held 3 day meeting with FCC on May 27/28/29](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/106012288627473/RDOF%20Ex%20Parte%20(6-1-2020\)%20(REDACTED\).pdf) to present [confidential test data that shows Starlink can indeed meet the low latency criteria](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10529094752788/SpaceX%20RDOF%20Ex%20Parte%20Confidentiality%20Request%20for%20Exhibit%20A%20(5-29-2020\).pdf):

    &gt; ...  on May 27, 28, and 29, 2020, ... SpaceX discussed [with the FCC] the draft Public Notice that would establish procedures for Auction 904. As demonstrated in Exhibit A, SpaceX explained that its system easily clears the Commission’s 100 ms threshold for low-latency services, even including its “processing time” during unrealistic worst-case situations.

    &gt; Exhibit A, which is marked as “Confidential Information,” concerns SpaceX’s proprietary network latency testing information and internal performance data. This is company-specific, competitively-sensitive, business confidential and/or proprietary and commercial information concerning SpaceX’s operations that would not routinely be made available to the public, and has been carefully guarded from competitors. If it were disclosed, SpaceX’s potential competitors could use it to determine information regarding SpaceX’s competitive position, operations, and performance, and could use that information to gain a competitive advantage over SpaceX.

5. Some news articles, although they don't get into as much details:

* [FCC awarding up to $16 billion to address U.S. areas lacking broadband service](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-telecom-internet/fcc-awarding-up-to-16-billion-to-address-u-s-areas-lacking-broadband-service-idUSKBN23G29R?utm_source=reddit.com): This is already posted to this subreddit, but it's really vague.

* [FCC Clears Way for SpaceX to Vie for Rural Broadband Subsidies](https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/fcc-clears-way-for-spacex-to-vie-for-rural-broadband-subsidies): A better article that included some quotes from Pai and O’Rielly



PS: FCC has 5 commissioners including the chairman, only 3 commissioners may be members of the same political party. Pai and O'Rielly are Republican and Starks is a Democrat, so it looks like this decision has bi-partisan support.",/r/spacex/comments/h04on0/fcc_just_voted_to_allow_starlink_to_bid_on_low/

#GPS Block III, Space Vehicle 3 (Columbus)

## Overview

GPS III are the third generation of the U.S. Space Force's NAVSTAR Global Positioning System satellites. The GPS III development contract was awarded to a team led by Lockheed Martin. Block III will improve position, navigation, and timing services for warfighter and civil users yielding superior system security, accuracy and reliability. When fully deployed, the GPS III constellation will feature a cross-linked command and control architecture, allowing the entire GPS constellation to be updated simultaneously from a single ground station. Additionally, a new spot beam capability for enhanced military (M-Code) coverage and increased resistance to hostile jamming will be incorporated. These enhancements will contribute to improved accuracy and assured availability for military and civilian users worldwide.

Lockheed Martin's flight-proven A2100 bus serves as the GPS III spacecraft platform. Unlike the GPS IIF satellite, the GPS III satellite features an apogee propulsion system. The satellite features a LEROS-1C engine as an apogee propulsion system as well as 2 deployable solar arrays to generate power. ITT, Clifton, N.J. provides the navigation payload, and General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Gilbert, Ariz., provides the Network Communications Element (NCE) which includes the UHF Crosslink and Tracking Telemetry &amp; Command (TT&amp;C) subsystems.

This mission launches the third GPS III satellite into orbit, and is the second GPS launch for SpaceX. Although the GPS III SV01 launch aboard Falcon 9 expended the booster, this mission's booster will be recovered via ASDS landing.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather, and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

spacex,"It's that time again! As per usual, we like to keep things as tight as possible. If you have content you created to share, whether that be images of the launch, videos, GIF's, etc, they go here.
# Photographer Contest
We decided to try out something new this time. 

 This time we are running a contest in this thread. You can submit your pictures related to this mission. That might be Falcon 9 on the launch pad, a launch picture or a streak shot of a starlink overfly. We will put this thread into contest mode and announce the winner when the droneship arrives back at Port Canaveral.

The winner will be allowed to post their picture directly on r/SpaceX and will get a special flair.

Rules:

- If no post reaches more than +10 votes , no winner will be selected
- You need to own the picture you are submitting
- 1 picture per person ( If you want to show more mark the one you are entering with #Contest)

If you have any feedback or ideas how to improve this contest, please send us a modmail!


## *As usual, our standard media thread rules apply:*

* **All top level comments must consist of an image, video, GIF, tweet or article.**
* If you're an amateur photographer, submit your content here. Professional photographers with subreddit accreditation can continue to submit to the front page, we also make exceptions for outstanding amateur content!
* Those in the aerospace industry (with subreddit accreditation) can likewise continue to post content on the front page.
* Mainstream media articles should be submitted here. Quality articles from dedicated spaceflight outlets *may* be submitted to the front page.
* **Direct all questions to the live launch thread.**",/r/spacex/comments/gw76k5/rspacex_starlink7_media_thread_photographer/

spacex,"Hello! It is u/RocketLover0119 hosting the recovery thread for core B1058.1 after successfully lofting S2 and Dragon to orbit with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley for the historic DM-2 mission, which returned american astronauts, on an american rocket, from american soil, back into orbit and to the ISS. Below is a table on the ships and their duties and status, as well as updates and resources.

## About DM-2

""On Saturday, May 30 at 3:22 p.m. EDT, SpaceX’s [Falcon 9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) launched [Crew Dragon’s second demonstration (Demo-2) mission](https://www.spacex.com/static/images/launches/Dem0-2_Artwork.png) from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the next day Crew Dragon autonomously docked to the International Space Station. This test flight with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board the [Dragon spacecraft](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/) returned human spaceflight to the United States.

Demo-2 is the final major test for SpaceX’s human spaceflight system to be certified by NASA for operational crew missions to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX is returning human spaceflight to the United States with one of the safest, most advanced systems ever built, and NASA’s Commercial Crew Program is a turning point for America’s future in space exploration that lays the groundwork for future missions to the [Moon](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/moon/), [Mars](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/), [and beyond](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/).""

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 7 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/hitura-nobad, your host for this mission.

#  Mission Overview

The eight Starlink launch overall and the seventh operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession) rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

spacex," This post is a compilation of Elon Musk and SpaceX presentation for Astro2020 regarding Starlink and Starship

[Jeff Foust on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/jeff_foust/status/1254818901944344576?s=20)

""Elon  Musk is giving a presentation at a public meeting of an Astro2020  astrophysics decadal survey cmte meeting on efforts to mitigate  brightness of Starlink satellites. First “VisorSat” satellites, with  sunshade to block reflections off antennas, planned to be on next  launch. ""

""Musk also says that  SpaceX is implementing an “orientation roll” on those satellites whose  orbits are being raised to reduce reflections off solar panels.""

""Musk  estimates the existing Starlink satellites, including those without any  brightness mitigations, will be deorbited in 3-4 years, in part because  they’ll be rendered obsolete by v2 satellites with  “far greater  throughput.”""

""Musk says darkening the satellites is “quite simple, actually” and that “we’ll feel a bit silly in hindsight.”""

""Musk:  think 550 km altitude is the right approach for LEO broadband  constellations, but don’t know if there will be a lot of other systems.  “The big challenge is not going bankrupt.” ""

""Musk  says he’s “pretty interested” to talk with astronomy community on ways  to launch or even build a large space telescope, “maybe a planet imager  or something like this.”""

""Musk  briefly mentions Starship launch system, says that “we’ll see regular  flights, I think, within a couple years.” Notes that it could play a  role in launching space based telescopes. ""

["".@elonmusk:  The goal of @SpaceX is to make Starlink satellites ""invisible to the  naked eye within a week of launch"".

[.@elonmusk  What the public sees is mostly the #Starlink objects during orbit  raise. Once the objects reach station, the source of brightness is the  reflection from antennas. We tried blacking out the antennas on Darksat  and it worked, but sun shades will work better. #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254817746224742405?s=20)

[I  will say that this presentation by @elonmusk for #Astro2020 includes  the most detailed view of the Starlink satellites I have yet seen. He's  reiterating the point about the goal of Starlink to not yield an impact  to science.](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254818492177514508?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  : We're interested in replacing the earliest Starlink sats we launched  as the tech progresses. We expect the 1st generation sats to be replaced  on a timescale of 3-4 years. We do not want 'ancient electronics' in  orbit like GEO sats up there for 15, 20 years. #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254821665264959498?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  , in response to a question from the #Astro2020 WG: We support a  regulatory framework that requires satellite operators to keep object  brightness ""within limits that don’t fundamentally inhibit science.""  #Starlink](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254819504518922253?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  reiterates: ""If there’s any situation where we’re impeding science, we  will take corrective action."" #Starlink #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254822241465860097?s=20)

[As  an aside, @elonmusk mentioned the large diameter of the Starship faring  and its ability to launch ""quite a big thing"" in it, referring to a  question about using SpaceX hardware to launch telescopes and similar  missions into space. #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254822814592335876?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  : The benefit of hindsight suggests that satellite visibility  mitigation efforts are quite simple; reduce albedo of surfaces or shade  them. ""It's not that hard."" #Starlink #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254824391621238784?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  : ""The big challenge for LEO constellations is not going bankrupt. This  is quite hard. I wouldn’t say we’re out of the woods in this regard.”  Wouldn’t expect to see a large number of LEO constellations. Hopes for  just one (presumably his). #Starlink #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254824707787911168?s=20)

[Patricia  Cooper (@SpaceX) briefly discusses RFI even though it's outside the  scope of this meeting.

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 6 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shahar603, your host for this mission.

#  Mission Overview

The seventh Starlink launch overall and the sixth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession) rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

spacex,"[Elon gets into it with Eric Berger and twitterverse](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1250612062989905921), here's highlights: -

Eric Berger: ""SpaceX is surely saving money on launches, and if the Falcon 9 weren't already insanely cheaper than everyone else, the company could cut prices substantially.""

**Elon:** ""True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they’d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.""

Eric Berger: ""Maybe check Block 5’s record [on reliability].""

**Elon:** ""Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test.""

Michael Sheetz: ""How much less?""

**Elon:** ""Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only [American] rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.""

Everyday Astronaut: ""Atlas V is an American rocket (well minus the engines ;)""

**Elon:** ""Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.""

~~[CProphet sidenote: believe Airbus manufacture Atlas V airframe]~~ 

**Elon:** ""Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch""

**Elon:** ""Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!""

Tobi Li: ""What Is the latest SN number for the raptor engine?""

**Elon:** ""SN26""

Sivakumar Kumar: ""What do you think about @RocketLab’s latest retrieval effort?""

**Elon:** ""Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle.""

**Elon:** ""I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done :)""

Everyday Astronaut: ""It’s insane how quick SN4 is coming together. It makes sense when you build a factory AROUND your rockets (not vice versa), cool to see mass manufacturing taking an early lead in development vs one off prototyping. I hope when it’s closer to done I can get a tour from you ;)""

**Elon:** ""Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet …""

Everyday Astronaut: ""It’d be so cool to do a tour of Hawthorne vs Boca Chica and see the differences in philosophies between early SpaceX vs current. Boca Chica is just a giant playground / test bed, which is cool!""

**Elon:** ""Sure""

Keith Mansfield: ""Everything crossed for SN4. This time!""

**Elon:** ""That’s for sure! [Smiling face with open mouth and cold sweat]""

Michael Baylor: ""Will SN4 hop to 20 km or just 150 m if the pressure tests and static fire goes well?""

**Elon:** ""SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.""

Analysis: Elon sounds stressed, which is understandable. Only a couple of days until SN4 pressure test - and its already made redundant by SN5/6.

#Starlink-6 (STARLINK V1.0-L6)

We are looking for launch thread hosts. If you are interested in hosting please send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fspacex).

## Overview

The seventh Starlink launch overall and the sixth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

## About The Recovery

SpaceX is going to conclude the CRS-20 Cargo Dragon mission to the International Space Station on April 7th with the deorbit and recovery of this spacecraft. Dragon will splash down in the Pacific Ocean approximately 815 km southwest of  Los Angeles. The west coast dragon recovery ship NRC Quest will be waiting at the landing zone to pick dragon up and bring it back to the harbour.

spacex,"*SpaceX has provided the following statement from CONAE, translated to English, regarding the postponement of the SAOCOM 1B mission:*

**The launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite is postponed**
 
The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation and the National Commission for Space Activities (CONAE) announce the decision to postpone the launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite, originally scheduled for the end of March.
 
This decision has been made considering the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and that could affect the availability of own resources and foreign third-party resources, necessary not only for a safe insertion into orbit, but also for further operation of the satellite.
 
This postponement has been agreed with the company providing the launch service, SpaceX, considering that it is the best decision in these moments of uncertainty and dynamism about the situation that the whole world suffers because of COVID-19.
 
This measure will be supplemented with activities at the launch base that will ensure the conditions for adequate protection of the SAOCOM 1B satellite at the SpaceX facilities.
 
The authorities of this Commission will await the evolution of the conditions that will make possible the resume of the activities related to the launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite and its subsequent reliable injection into its final orbit according to the original plans.",/r/spacex/comments/foav19/statement_from_conae_regarding_the_postponement/

spacex,"Hello! it is u/RocketLover0119 back at it hosting the recovery thread for the launch of the 5th batch of operational Starlink satellites! Below is info on the mission, info on the core/fairing, updates, and more!

## About Starlink

"" SpaceX is leveraging its experience in building rockets and spacecraft to deploy the world's most advanced broadband internet system. With performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet and a global network unbounded by ground infrastructure limitations, Starlink will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable. Each Starlink satellite weights approximately 260 kg and features a compact, flat-panel design that minimizes volume, allowing for a dense launch stack to take full advantage of Falcon 9’s launch capabilities. With four powerful phased array and two parabolic antennas on each satellite, an enormous amount of throughput can be placed and redirected in a short time, for an order of magnitude lower cost than traditional satellite-based internet. Starlink satellites are on the leading edge of on-orbit debris mitigation, meeting or exceeding all regulatory and industry standards. At end of their life cycle, the satellites will utilize their on-board propulsion system to deorbit over the course of a few months. In the unlikely event their propulsion system becomes inoperable, the satellites will burn up in Earth’s atmosphere within 1-5 years, significantly less than the hundreds or thousands of years required at higher altitudes. Further, Starlink components are designed for full demisability. Starlink is targeting service in the Northern U.S. and Canada in 2020, rapidly expanding to near global coverage of the populated world by 2021. Additional information on the system can be found at starlink.com. ""

## Core B1048.5

The core utilized in this mission is core 48. This core completed a historic first for SpaceX, which is launching and landing a core for the 5th time. Previously, this core flew on the Iridium-7, SAOCOM-1A, Nusantara Satu, and the 2nd launch of Starlink missions. Unfortunately, during this mission core 48 failed to land. According to Musk, an engine turned off (some speculate an engine went boom, similar to CRS-1). The core had a good ascent until the anomaly, separated stages, deployed fins, and completed what appears to have been a 2 engine entry burn (speculation). Beyond that, it seems it didn't even light for landing, and smashed into the ocean at terminal speed. RIP B1048.

## Fairing

In this mission, the fairings are flight-proven. These 2 halves both previously supported the first launch of Starlink in May of last year, with these halves being fished from the sea by GO Navigator and GO Searcher. This is only the second time SpaceX has utilized previously flown fairings, with high hopes of continuing to recover and reuse other halves. The 2 halves were not caught, but were, however, retrieved from the ocean by Ms. tree and Ms. Chief.

As usual, our standard media thread rules apply:

All top level comments must consist of an image, video, GIF, tweet or article. If you're an amateur photographer, submit your content here. Professional photographers with subreddit accreditation can continue to submit to the front page, we also make exceptions for outstanding amateur content! Those in the aerospace industry (with subreddit accreditation) can likewise continue to post content on the front page. Mainstream media articles should be submitted here. Quality articles from dedicated spaceflight outlets may be submitted to the front page.

spacex,"Hey everyone,

I want to introduce my new Twitter bot to you:

#### [ The Starlink Deployment Update Bot](https://twitter.com/StarlinkUpdates)

### What can it do?
It is posting updated graphs of the Starlink satellite attitude for each launch once a day on twitter.

### How does it work?
#### Part 1: The Scrapper
It uses wget to download https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/supplemental/starlink.txt three times a day, 1 hour after the update is released by SpaceX, and saves it onto my Server.
#### Part 2: Calculator
The next script loads the TLEs and calculates different orbit heights from them.
#### Part 3: Separator
The following script splits the TLEs after the different missions and appends to the archive of previously calculated data points for the specific launch.
#### Part 4: Generator/Plotter
The plotter uses Matplotlib to generated an updated graph from the given data and saves it as png.
#### Part 5: Poster
The last script uploads the png to twitter and posts the thread once a day.

### Future Expansions
- Possibility to highlight specific sats
- Loading additional data from the r/SpaceX API
- Plotting other interesting values than just orbital height

### Thanks
- u/thevehicledestroyer for helping to debug my TLE generation code making it more accurate
- Dr. T.S. Kelso for providing me the exact times when SpaceX publishes new TLEs",/r/spacex/comments/exrmyu/introducing_the_starlink_deployment_update_bot/

spacex,"Hello! I'm u/hitura-nobad, the last-minute stand-in for this recovery thread.

### Booster Recovery
SpaceX deployed OCISLY, GO Quest and Hawk to carry out the booster recovery operation. B1051.3 successfully landed on Of Course I Still Love You.

### Fairing Recovery
Go Ms. Tree was able to catch on fairing half in her large net, while Go Ms. Chief missed it and the fairing made a soft water landing, and will be retrieved using a smaller net.

&amp;nbsp;

spacex,"Welcome to another r/SpaceX meta thread, where we talk about how the sub is running and the stuff going on behind the scenes, and where everyone can offer input on things they think are good, bad or anything in between.

Our [last meta thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/cbrhk0/july_2019_meta_thread_new_mods_new_bots/) went pretty well, so we’re sticking with the new format going forward.

In short, we're leaving this as a stub and writing up a handful of topics as top level comments to get the ball rolling. Of course, we invite you to start comment threads of your own to discuss any other subjects of interest as well.

As usual, you can ask or say anything in freely in this thread. We will only remove abusive spam and bigotry.

This mission is a test of Crew Dragon's abort capability as part of NASA'a Commercial Crew Integrated Capability program (CCiCap). SpaceX will launch a Crew Dragon capsule from LC-39A, Kennedy Space Center on a fully fueled Falcon 9 rocket and then trigger the launch escape system during the period of maximum dynamic pressure. The abort sequence terminates launcher thrust, separates Dragon and trunk from the second stage, and ignites the eight SuperDraco engines which pull the capsule away from the launch vehicle. Following shutdown of the SuperDracos Dragon coasts to apogee, separates from the trunk, and lands in the Atlantic Ocean under parachutes. Crew Dragon will be recovered by GO Searcher after splashdown approximately 30 km from the launch site. This flight does not go to orbit.

Falcon 9 core 1046.4 flies in expendable configuration, without legs, grid fins, or TEA-TEB engine ignition fluid. Since the abort sequence will be initiated before staging, the second stage has not been equipped with an Mvac engine or the associated hardware, but is expected to be fueled. Falcon 9 will likely break apart due to aerodynamic loads immediately following Crew Dragon's escape.

The abort test occurs approximately 80-100 seconds into flight. Breakup of Falcon 9 is expected within seconds thereafter. Splashdown of the capsule will occur within a few minutes following abort.

##Mission-Specific FAQ

###Will the flight termination system be used?

From the [Environmental Assessment](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/environmental/nepa_docs/review/launch/media/Final_EA_and_FONSI_for_SpaceX_In-flight_Dragon_Abort_508_A.pdf 'FAA.gov (PDF)') it does not appear that the autonomous flight termination system will be used. The abort sequence will be triggered by a ""simulated loss of thrust"" (rather than a disintegrating rocket). The booster is expected to become uncontrollable after Dragon separation and break apart from the intense aerodynamic forces within seconds. A conflagration is possible, but not certain.

###Is there a chance the booster will land, and what is the downrange launch hazard area for?

The Environmental Assessment explicitly states that no landing attempt (or landing gear) will be a part of this mission. Although environmental assessments often contain outdated information, this is also supported by the lack of the usual booster recovery communications permit. The downrange [launch hazard area](https://twitter.com/raul74cz/status/1212197735820083200 'Twitter, @Raul74Cz') appears to represent the improbable scenario in which the abort system fails to terminate thrust. Falcon 9 or its post reentry debris would fall in this hazard area.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if changes or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

### [-&gt; Jump to Comments &lt;-](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/{THREAD_ID_CAMPAIGN}/jcsat-18_kacific1_launch_campaign_thread/#siteTable_t3_{THREAD_ID_CAMPAIGN})

JCSAT-18 is a mobile broadband communications payload built for Sky Perfect JSAT Corporation of Japan and will service Asia Pacific. Kacific1 is a high throughput broadband internet payload built for Kacific Broadband Satellites and will service certain high demand areas of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Both payloads share a single chassis.

SpaceX will launch the Boeing built dual payload satellite to geostationary transfer orbit from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral AFS on a Falcon 9, and the first-stage booster is expected to land downrange on the OCISLY droneship.

This is SpaceX's **13th** mission of 2019, its **6th** commercial flight of the year and the **77th** Falcon 9 launch overall. It will re-use the FT Block 5 booster flown on NASA CRS-17 and CRS-18.

## Mission-Specific FAQ

### Why is this mission landing on the droneship downrange, rather than back at Cape Canaveral?

Boosting satellites into geostationary transfer orbit takes a lot more energy/delta-V (i.e. propellant) than just into low earth orbit, given the apogee of the former is 35 786 km as opposed to 200-2000 km for the latter. This requires the Falcon 9 second stage to perform a substantial extra to inject the satellite into this orbit from LEO, which requires that sufficient propellant be left over from insertion into the initial LEO parking orbit. This in turn requires the first stage to do more of the work accelerating the second stage to orbital velocity, meaning that it in turn is both traveling at a higher speed at separation and is further downrange from the Cape, while having less propellant remaining.

Therefore, with less propellant available and more required to boost back, landing on the droneship allows the booster to efficiently use its remaining propellant margin to perform an entry burn, reducing re-entry heating, and leaving it enough margin for the landing burn. 


### How come this mission is landing if its heavier than the 5500 kg reusable GTO limit?

The payload will be delivered into a subsynchronous GTO, with an apogee lower than the standard 35 786 km, which naturally takes less propellant from the second stage to raise its orbit to. Therefore, the second stage can in turn do more of the work injecting into a parking orbit, allowing the first stage enough propellant margin to land. While this results in a somewhat longer time for the satellite to come into service, and requires a larger propellant tank for its kick motor, the customer evidently decided the substantially cheaper launch cost vs. an expendable or Falcon Heavy launch was worth these relatively modest downsides. This has been done on several prior missions, such as Telstar 18V and 19V.

## Watching the Launch

Check out the [Watching a Launch page](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/faq/watching) on this sub's FAQ, which gives a summary of every viewing site and answers many more common questions, as well as [Ben Cooper's launch viewing guide](http://www.launchphotography.com/Delta_4_Atlas_5_Falcon_9_Launch_Viewing.html), [Launch Rats](https://launchrats.com/), and the [Space Coast Launch Ambassadors](https://scla.space) which have interactive maps, photos and detailed information about each site.


### I want the best view of the launch. Where should I go?

The KSCVC LC-39 gantry is indisputably the best option (cost aside) and an incredible experience, but is now sold out. The KSCVC Saturn V Center is second best, and is first come, first serve so get there early (before 9 am recommended)! Playalinda beach is the closest low-cost option by a considerable margin, though the view of the pad is obstructed by dunes and scrub, while Titusville and Port Canaveral are further but free/low cost. There are a number of additional options further away; check out the information on our [Watching a Launch FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/faq/watching) (courtesy Julia Bergeron and the SLCA) for more.


### I'd like the closest possible view of this launch's booster landing. What's my best option?

Unfortunately, since the landing will be far downrange, you'll be lucky to even catch a glimpse of the entry burn (which is possible, though far from guaranteed, anywhere you have a clear shot to the eastern horizon). Other than that, this isn't possible, sorry, so you should optimize for launch accordingly.
