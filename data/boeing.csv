boeing,"Hello,

I just recently traveled for a position i started with Boeing as an field service rep. However, as I was there I realized this was not gonna be a good fit for me. I have been with the company more than a month and feel horrible but at the same time I dont want to do something I will not enjoy. There are some better positions internally that I am interested that would suit me better. I can stay here a while if need be but I would rather transfer sooner rather than later. How much should i wait before applying for a transfer? Can I be denied this transfer possibly if I dont hit a set time period?

Thank you",/r/boeing/comments/hto1ee/internal_transfer/

boeing,"The 737 definitely should not have had the life it has. It is a thoroughly outdated plane that was designed as a cheap regional jet without even pylons, and Boeing is trying to make it a damn transatlantic airliner out of it.

My question is: Why didn't Boeing just kill it in the 90s after the merger with McDonnell Douglas? McD was already making the MD-80 &amp; MD-90, developed from the DC-9, which, unlike the 737, was built from the ground up as a domestic airliner (which it was used as for its whole life). Boeing also had the 757, in all its glory, which was:

A. A much newer, more modern airliner, that was designed from the ground up to replace the 727

B. Not being used for routes beyond its potential (even the routes it's used on now are still well within the 757's capability)

Why not just kill the 737, and replace the -400 and -800 with a smaller 757 built to match the -400's capabilities, and then replace the -500, -300, and -700 with the 717 and an MD-80/90 with 717-style upgrades? The MD-80s were hardy planes that would have a long life. The 737's production numbers now are YUGE, but at the time of the merger, the edge it had was nowhere near as massive (2975 units of the plane were sold by 97, compared to the 2283 DC-9/MD-80/MD-90s sold). Why not just make 2 product lines for two different things instead of clumsily trying to develop one plane into all the roles? Boeing clearly wasn't averse to it, as they put the 717 into production, which would have DESTROYED the 737-600. Most of the work was already done.",/r/boeing/comments/hrzk1a/why_didnt_boeing_discontinue_the_737_after_the/

boeing,"In light of of 747 production ending, I was wondering how much longer we can realistically expect to be able to take a flight on one. Since the coronavirus outbreak began and people stopped flying most airlines have little use for huge aircraft anymore. Many -400 operators who were planning to fly for a few more years have now retired their 747s early. Many -400 frames are pushing 30 years old now and sadly they probably won’t be flying passengers anymore very soon. The A380 isn’t doing much better and has also been grounded or retired by several airlines.

Since there aren’t that many -8i models in service to begin with it’s not that unlikely they would be next to go. Even if air travel demand picks up again soon it will be gradual, and a much more efficient 777 or A350 will probably be big enough to meet the needs of most airlines for several more years.
The few airlines that fly the 747-8i could all probably use some extra cash right now more than some huge aircraft they can’t fill.

Despite passengers not flying, there is still huge air cargo demand. Due to this I think the 747 is less doomed in general than the A380 which has no freighter version. All the -8i frames are relatively new and would probably be worth a lot as cargo haulers, so I suspect many will soon be converted to -8f models. Honestly I hope this doesn’t come true any time soon, but the way the world is right now it’s not looking hopeful.",/r/boeing/comments/hqyedn/will_the_7478i_survive_the_pandemic/

boeing,"Hi all,

I was an intern back in 2019 in flight controls in the midst of the whole 737 MAX fiasco. I really enjoyed being able to surround myself with airplanes, going to the labs, playing around with the flight simulators, etc. I never received a return offer (guessing because of the 737 MAX incident) so I started applying for jobs elsewhere and have been working as a software engineer at Microsoft since March (I studied EE with a minor in CS). The money is really good but I don’t feel fulfilled working on Azure/cloud technologies. 

I also remember that I didn’t particularly enjoy the work at Boeing as an intern (maybe it’s because I didn’t have much) but loved the environment of being around airplanes. I wanted to do something cool like write code or do FPGA work on the avionics systems, and would ask my manager which team does that, but he basically said that you gotta go to Rockwell Collins and that we do more systems level work which sounded less interesting to me. I wouldn’t mind returning as an FPGA engineer or an electrical engineer, though my focus was more on FPGA/embedded systems in college, which is why I was easily able to apply for software roles as well. I don’t care about money I just want to love what I do everyday. Am I in a case of the grass is always greener? Or should I try applying back to Boeing. Thoughts?

boeing,"Hello,

I know this is really specific question but since it is ""your"" aircraft I hope that someone here undestands that well. In fact this happened to me few months ago and there was quite a huge discusion about that in company because none could really explain that.

You have 747 and you prepare it for long flight. About 140 tons of fuel. That means wings full and about 30 tons in CWT. But the fuel scavenge system is INOP. Does not matter if electric or hydromechanical, but let's say it is electric. It is MEL **28-15-01B Center Tank Fuel Use Limitation** 

&gt; May be inoperative provided:   
&gt;  
&gt;a. Fuel scavenge pump is deactivated.   
&gt;  
&gt;b. Center tank fuel is considered payload fuel.   
&gt;  
&gt;c. Maximum allowable zero fuel weight is reduced by the first 1360 kg of center tank fuel.   
&gt;  
&gt;d. The first 1360 kg of center tank fuel is considered unusable.

Points a, c, d are clear to me. I understand that there will be 1360 kg of fuel stuck in CWT and I won't be able to use it.

But can someone explain me point b? I though I have to reduce allowable payload on the flight by amount of fuel in CWT.( It reminded me jettison pumps problems on B777 when the fuel can get stuck in center tank which means that they would not be able to get rid of that and would be landing with ""empty wings and heavy center tank and wings would not be happy."") But it makes no sense for scavenge system. And it was confirmed by our engineering department that the only limitation is that 1360 kg and not whole CWT. But it took them while to find out and said they ""do believe"" the ""payload fuel"" is supposed to mean usable fuel. Which would make all clear but I have never seen ""payload fuel"" in any other manual that DDG for 747. Nothing in B777 or B787. I do not have any other ""huge Boeings"".

And same ""payload fuel"" term is used in MEL regarding jettison pumps. And yes, I could guess they mean it is usable fuel but it seems to be very tricky.

I'm looking at a position in Everett, WA (not at Boeing)

I've been trying to get an idea of what salary will be involved, and I figured rates in the area are probably tied to Boeing since it's such a large employer.

Her response was that if you do not have a retention rating, you should be safe from an ILO. When the skill teams get together to decide who from which rating will be let go, you effectively won’t even appear on their list of people to choose from. That’s how I’m interpreting her response.

boeing,"Boeing has provided a lot of things to help keep people safe during this pandemic. Masks, gloves, hand sanitizer everywhere, hand washing stations, temperature screenings, etc. Utilized properly, these resources would probably be pretty effective.

Unfortunately, many of the people who work in the factory are idiots.


Some of the things I am witnessing:
-	People removing their masks to speak to each other from one to two feet away. Like it is obstructing their ability to be heard.
-	So many people leaving their nose uncovered for comfort.
-	I’ve heard people mock others for being careful or concerned.
-	The 6 foot rule is rarely followed outside of standup meetings.
-	Still seeing people leave the restroom without washing their hands.
-	On the way in and out of the factory, there are still a hoard of people shoulder to shoulder.
-	Many people show up without a mask on and remove the mask as soon as they walk out the door, while in the middle of the hoard.

I’m sure I’m forgetting other things but this is enough to illustrate the point I want to make. Wearing cheap fabric masks is not going to prevent anyone from getting sick if we have to rely on the personal accountability of morons.

boeing,So I’ve been to workday and the only difference I can see if you take the VLO  over waiting for the ILO is you will get your medical extended for 3 months. It seems that either way you get the one week of pay for every year of service and I’m not interested in being rehired. I”m 62 and have been with the company for 10 years and I’m trying to decide if I should just roll the dice and try to eek out a few more months on the payroll before the real layoffs start given the fact they will have to send out WARN notices giving me at least another 2 months.  With my age I really don’t think I have a good prospect of finding another job and will probably just ride out unemployment until that runs out then start drawing social security and move to Thailand. ,/r/boeing/comments/g8ihzd/any_real_difference_between_vlo_and_ilo/

boeing,"What is the feasibility of retrofitting unused commercial airline fuselages with reverse pressure systems to create a vacuum chamber that can accommodate a large number of patients that need breathing assistance? The idea is to have an area with very low atmospheric pressure with breathing lines coming in with normal atmospheric pressure.  The drop down oxygen supply infrastructure could provide that.  Seats could remain in the fuselage with the potential of each seat being populated with a patient. These areas would accommodate low to mid level patients that are struggling to breathe. We basically remove the weight of the atmosphere which provides easier breathing. Not full assistance like a ventilator, but enough to give a large quantity of people the assistance they need to breathe and fight infection.

boeing,"Update COVID-19 – March 20, 2020
Our Union is continuously working on your behalf and is very concerned about the current situation.  
 
1) You have the right to take time off work.
So far your union leadership has secured that members who are high risk, or who need to care for children that are out of school, or are “concerned with working on site due to Coronavirus,” can take time off from work, and use excused LWOP, without having to exhaust benefits or face discipline. Be sure that you follow your organization’s requirements for reporting daily absences.
Anyone placed on mandatory quarantine and sent home due to COVID-19 or potential exposure to COVID-19 will be paid for up to 14 days. (The Company has defined mandatory quarantine as direction from Boeing Health Services and/or a public health official to quarantine because of a risk of COVID-19).
Anyone sent home by management due to being generally ill or has received direction from Health Services or a medical professional to remain out of work due to a general illness or non-COVID related illness will be able to use their benefits or excused LWOP to cover these absences.
We had reports that some managers were denying requests for excused LWOP. We asked Boeing to immediately educate their managers to correct this issue. We will continue to enforce these provisions. If you have an issue and need assistance, please contact your Steward and Business Rep. 
[NOTE: For an absence lasting more than 7 consecutive calendar days (other than vacation), contact the Boeing Leave Service Center at 866-473-2016 to request a leave of absence. When the system asks “How can I help you?” say “Leave Service Center” and have your WorkLife password available. If you are on excused LWOP to care for children that are out of school or are concerned with working on site due to Coronavirus, this will be a nonmedical or personal LOA, which provides three months of continued active medical coverage at the active employee rates.]
 
2) You have the right to continue to earn a living.
 
Excused LWOP provides options for some, but there are members that must have their paycheck. The union leadership has received calls from members that are frustrated we have not called for Boeing to shut down operations in Puget Sound. This union membership includes 32,000 families that depend on their paychecks to survive. If we demand that operations be shut down, we have no way of knowing how long a shutdown will last and how much pay members will receive.
If our factories are shut down, either by the state or the company, we will demand to bargain the effects of this change in working conditions to capture as many resources as we can for our members.
3) You have the right to a safe workplace.
In the meantime, it is incumbent upon all of us to hold Boeing to their own safety practices and enforce them on the shop floor. In areas where this is not happening, we need your help. Members should use the “Imminent Danger” clause to enact the contractual process designed to ensure members are safe in the workplace before work continues.
CONTRACT LANGUAGE READS:
16.1(c) Should the employee believe that there is imminent danger due to work required to be performed, the employee should inform the immediate supervisor and/or the responsible site safety manager or a designee. In addition, the employee may contact the Union Steward or a Health and Safety Institute (HSI) Site Safety Committee member who will assist in contacting the Site Safety Manager.
16.1(d) Work will not continue until the responsible Site Safety Manager or designee makes the final determination concerning the safety of the individual and the work to be performed.
 
Click here for the list of Site Safety Committee members.
 
4) Workers Should be Protected in Any Federal Bailout
Our Union is also working hard on the legislative front, at both the state and federal level. We are working closely with legislators to ensure that any aerospace industry bailout at the federal level includes protections for aerospace workers at Boeing and throughout the supply chain. 
We are also working with the Governor’s office and Employment Security Department officials to try and remove barriers to accessing unemployment insurance benefits for those workers who are at high risk of severe health consequences from COVID-19 infections due to their age or underlying medical conditions.

I am currently pursuing last semester of my Master's degree (only capstone project left) and in my application I only had start year as I wasn't sure when I'd finish my degree. I had tried to fix that with HireRight but they never updated the report.  
I replied Boeing Security the same day that I only have Bachelor's degree and at last semester- 3 credits due towards Masters degree. Provided all my transcripts too. I have also let my HR and hiring manager know about this.

I was watching a video on how to visually tell the differences between Airbus and Boeing planes, and when they were comparing the 737 to the A320, they mentioned how the design of the landing gears  holds the A320 higher of the ground, while the 737 has much lower clearance.

This got me thinking... I know that the design of the 737 MAX was the result of trying to fit bigger engines on a plane with less clearance, which led to the repositioning of the engines and the change in balance of the plane, etc.

Is there a reason they didn't just decide to redesign the landing gear to give the plane more clearance instead? Would that have been a simpler design change?",/r/boeing/comments/eq2v5o/a320neo_vs_737_max_design_question/

So its been about half a year since /u/sigmatic_minor has joined the mod team. I feel the board has become pretty active and we see more people participating regularly. Our average activity has increased since then and there is a noticeable increase in sub count. So here are some list of changes we put in up to the end of 2019 to look back on:

*sigmatic_minor put in a lot of leg work on /u/Automoderator and quick message features for helping clean up clutter around the board.

*There was an early attempt to start a dedicated FAQ thread for the sites of various region but it fell apart pretty quick and the idea was scrapped.

*We began including an Employment/Newbie thread to consolidate frequently asked questions that includes application, benefit, and employee life questions into one thread. This is due to trend of similar questions being asked very regularly. Some classics include, ""Is it normal to not hear back after x months?"", ""Does LTP cover this?"", and ""What should I wear for first day?"".

*Due to excessive spam post, we placed a minimum karma requirement to begin a thread. Throwaway users with employment related questions are still able to post in the stickied thread.

*In case users have not noticed, a wiki is actually up now. It currently contains a broad answer to some frequently asked question. Will update more as we see more posts made by our contributors (you guys) that answers other questions.

I plan to try coming up with a census survey to gauge our demographic a bit better.

CHICAGO—Emphasizing that the 62-year-old executive was just experiencing minor technical issues and would be back behind the podium shortly, Boeing officials scrambled to do damage control Monday after their new CEO Dave Calhoun erupted into flames during his first press conference. “I assure you, Mr. Calhoun is one of the safest board members in Boeing’s history and has never caught fire prior to today,” said Boeing spokesperson Karen Flynn, adding that Mr. Calhoun had undergone rigorous testing before being promoted to CEO, leaving the company stunned when he suddenly paused his speech, sent out an SOS signal, and burst into flames. “While we are devastated by the news, the reality of having executives is that there is always a risk that one will lose control, fly off the stage, and crash into the audience at high velocity. To the hundreds who died, or suffered severe injuries today, we sincerely apologize.” At press time, investigators found that Mr. Calhoun had failed to pay Boeing for additional safety protections that could have prevented him from exploding into millions of small, unidentifiable pieces.",/r/boeing/comments/eoo7el/boeing_scrambling_after_new_ceo_catches_fire/

boeing,"Hello, I recently got a job offer as a part-time software tester.  Currently, I'm a senior computer science student at university.  I was planning on going part-time with school while working the job.  However, I'm unsure if I should accept the offer.  The wage is $15 an hour which seems fairly low given the COL where I am.  My last QA internship paid $20 an hour and my school pays tutors $19 an hour.  Is this normal for Boeing?  Would it be wise to take the job to gain experience and get my foot in the door?  Ideally, I want to eventually move to Washington state and work at Boeing over there.  Is it feasible to transfer internally after working at one location for a year?

Also, I'm debating if I should finish my last year at an accredited online university, so that I'll have more flexibility with my schedule and not have to commute back-and-forth to my school.  Is this a wise move if it'll take me the same amount of time to graduate?  My current university is a top 20 CS school, but I'm not sure how valuable that truly is.

boeing," **A Time For Recusal: U.S. Judge Presiding Over Lion Air Cases Must Recuse Himself**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img aauy4vfrb9841...*

By: Anonymous

As the world watches, the United States’ largest exporter Boeing reels in crisis, one arguably of its own making. Those in Indonesia watch too as Boeing’s misconduct first came to light at the expense of the lives of their countrymen.

In the wake of the deaths of 346 people, including the death of 189 Indonesians on board Lion Air JT610, we have learned that two men, two U.S. judges, preside over two of the most important cases in global aviation litigation history. We have learned that one of these men, Judge Thomas M. Durkin, is part of an illustrious heritage, one of the so-called “Durkin 5” or “Durkin Bunch”, hailing from a veritable brethren of accomplished American lawyers and politicians who grew up in one of the United States’ quintessential American cities.\[1\] 

But whatever his pedigree may be, it is true in any country that the judge presiding over these cases should be free of bias, and even the appearance of bias would be enough for the judge to be recused. The need for the appearance of impartiality in the Boeing cases is even more important than ever as new reports surface of Boeing trying to influence airline executives to hold the party line and support Boeing’s story that the 737 max was not rushed to production and through certification.\[2\] Indonesians probably wince at the irony—the *New York Times* and others have written of Indonesia as backwards and corrupt and lamented the state of aviation safety there. And here we are now learning each week of the backroom dealings of Boeing that first ultimately led to the pulverizing death of 189 Indonesians into the depths of the Java Ocean, and then the annihilation of 157 more souls from more than thirty five different countries left in small burned pieces in a crater in Bishoftu.

Thus, now more than ever, the Boeing 737 Max litigation serves a vital global purpose. It is a way that the U.S. sends a message to the rest of the world that it is not hypocritical, that the corruption it laments and seeks to uncover in the rest of the world is not tolerated in its own forums and its own halls of justice and governance. The world will rely on the United States legal system and the United States Congress to force Boeing to be accountable. Boeing’s conduct rushing the 737 Max to the air at breakneck speeds has shone light on safety issues impacting millions of lives, including those in their planes and those on the ground.

A key issue in the Lion Air matter is whether the presiding Judge Durkin will invoke the *forum non-conveniens* doctrine to dismiss the cases out of the United States—it is common knowledge, as Congress highlighted in its questioning of Boeing’s now terminated CEO, that Boeing is using the threat of this doctrine to force the Lion Air plaintiffs to settle for lower amounts.\[3\] Families outside the U.S. are acutely aware of this doctrine as they have seen it drive other Boeing lawsuits out of the U.S. and sharply limit if not eliminate the chance for non-Europeans and non-Americans to receive fair compensation after the horrific loss of life in air disasters. We know that if Boeing files a *forum non-conveniens* motion, Judge Durkin rules on it by himself.

Our research tells us that U.S. federal law provides that “Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned… He shall also disqualify himself… where he has personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.”\[4\] To see that Judge Durkin should immediately recuse himself, it is not necessary to question his honor or integrity. His impartiality might reasonably be questioned by simply looking at the numerous connections he has to Boeing and or its U.S. counsel, some connections dating back over the course of his career and some as recent as September of 2019:

\-Boeing’s lead trial counsel is a renowned U.S. trial attorney Dan Webb. Mr. Webb was Judge Durkin’s boss, and as recently as October 17, 2019, Judge Durkin acknowledged his longstanding relationship with Webb and even stated that he meets Durkin regularly at some kind of US Attorney gathering.\[5\] Boeing’s counsel thus has unique insight into how the judge’s mind works, having known him and supervised him during formative years of his career.

\-Judge Durkin’s former firm was a global firm called Mayer Brown LLP where he was a partner from 1993 to 2013. It is well known that Mayer Brown advised Boeing at least from 2010 through 2013 through a policy advisor who was sitting on and continues to sit on Boeing’s Board of Directors.

\-Judge Durkin’s brother James Brian Durkin is a leader in the Illinois House of Representatives. In 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, an organization called the  Boeing Political Action Committee appears to have donated significant money to Representative Durkin’s campaign.

\-Judge Durkin’s other brother Kevin P. Durkin is an aviation attorney at the Clifford Law Offices which represent numerous ET302 victims. As evidenced by Congress’ questions of the now terminated Boeing CEO in October, the threat to dismiss Boeing lawsuits has focused on Lion Air cases. Indonesians have been told and now understand that If the Lion Air cases settle quickly, the value of the ET302 cases increases because those cases will remain as the sole U.S MAX victim litigation matter. Therefore, a ruling by Judge Durkin to dismiss Lion Air cases or statements by Judge Durkin which pressure Lion Air families to settle directly benefit the ET302 plaintiffs (and his brother) as it will increase or at the very least protect the value of the ET302 cases. 

When Judge Durkin summarized potential conflicts for the Lion Air Plaintiffs at the status conference in October of 2019, he only mentioned at a high level his connection to Dan Webb and loosely described his brother Kevin P. Durkin. He did not mention at all his own connection of Mayer Brown or Mayer Brown’s connection to Boeing during the time when Judge Durkin was there, and he did not mention at all his other brother’s receipt of Boeing PAC money. He did not mention how close-knit the Durkin family is (as has been reported and widely hailed as a cherished and almost folklore hallmark of the family). He also did not mention the well-recognized fact that the fate of the JT610 cases impact the ET302 cases and his brother’s fees—if the JT610 cases don’t settle quickly, the ET302 cases (and his brother’s fees) are put in jeopardy. 

Most troublingly, out of the blue, in a sudden and unexpected turn of events, in the same October 2019 conference where his longtime colleague Dan Webb appeared, Judge Durkin made statements indicating that in his view, the case law on *forum non-conveniens* would favor dismissing the Lion Air cases out of the United States:

***“You can't read these cases without coming away from it with the impression is the law is pretty -- pretty favorable to moving this case out and back to Indonesia.”***

He seemed to be warning the lawyers for Indonesian families that Boeing would be filing a “serious” motion—and all of this *before Boeing has filed any motion*, and all of this in the wake of an unprecedented set of not one but two crashes where by the time Judge Durkin made his statements, it was well established that Boeing’s conduct on U.S. soil was the main cause of the death of all 346 people. 

People outside the U.S. are not scholars of the U.S. legal system, but even common sense dictates that Judge Durkin should do right by the Boeing cases and recuse himself. It is not necessary to question whether someone spoke to him, whether there was actual pressure placed on him directly or indirectly, through colleagues, family, or otherwise. The presence of actual improper communications or actual corruption does not matter. U.S. law requires that he recuse himself anyway. There are just too many connections for any well-meaning judge to remain impartial, consciously or subconsciously. At the very least, he should do what he did in one prior American litigation matter where he had potential conflicts less numerous or dramatic than those here, where he still offered to recuse himself if any party requested him to do so.\[6\] He has not made that offer to date.

Judge Durkin will preside over many important cases in his career, but equally important are the ones he should not preside over. We thank him for presiding so far over the cases concerning the loss of so many Indonesians, but we ask him to step aside now in the name of fairness and not give Boeing a chance to manipulate yet another outcome. Boeing must be held accountable for all loss of life in the United States, and the families of the men, women, and children who died on the 737 Max carrying Lion Air Flight JT610 deserve no less fairness than the citizens of the numerous countries affected by the 737 Max crash of ET302.

boeing,"The PTO Transition fact sheet states the following: 

&gt; * New hires on or before June 21, 2019, begin accruing the remaining half of eligible vacation hours at the beginning of the 7th month of employment. On Dec. 20, 2019, their Vacation hours will convert to PTO and they will begin accruing PTO weekly.
&gt; 
&gt; * New hires after June 21, 2019, will have their vacation hours converted to PTO on December 20, 2019, and will begin accruing their PTO weekly at the beginning of their 7th month of employment.

I was hired after June 21, and my PTO balance in ETS shows 88 hours instead of the expected 40 (I still had all 40 hours of vacation left), which means my frontloading somehow became 11 days of PTO instead of just 5 days vacation. The new PTO calculator tool also shows me accruing PTO rate at 6 month date.

I am wondering if this was actually intentional, or if it will be clawed back. If it is correct, does that mean I have way more PTO then someone hired before June 21?",/r/boeing/comments/eimzp3/if_you_were_hired_in_2019_check_your_pto_balance/

boeing,"To all my former compatriots at The Boeing Company, despite numerous issues challenging you this past year I just wanted to say my heart is with you all. You've had numerous failures and issues that I can only imagine bring many of you enormous amounts of stress.

That being said, before I left I noticed a great degree of abnormally poor desicions amongst upper management (mainly executive level). The bean counters and finance personnel adored short term gains over realistic results. In my opinion, this resulted in a catastrophic  realm of too many suppliers and contractors which easily broke down layers of communication. 

Another issue is Boeing is a giant institution and the fact that it is so broken apart into fractional subsectors is frightening. Large bureaucracy is not how you innovate anything but it is good at acquiring wealth in the hands of the few.

My only hope is that the execs realize this and look past greed to actually generate stability. Because they're obviously not on that path and competitors will eat you alive if it is not corrected.

God bless all of you, my heart is with you and I hope you correct your institutional issues.

boeing,"Boeing will not build B737s for a while, with the [last of the NG Variant rolling out of the factory](https://simpleflying.com/last-boeing-737-ng-klm/) and [B737 MAX production halted as well](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-17/boeing-halts-737-max-production/11805552), Boeing won’t be building any 737s in 2020 (unless MAX gets back into production)

In 2014, Boeing said the B737 MAX was intended to be the replacement for the B737NG in 2020, but the MAX crisis has affected these plans a lot in 2018 and 2019 with two deadly crashes taking over 300 innocent lives. The last B737 NG is being rolled out of the factory ready to be delivered to KLM as PH-BCL, but the NG series won’t have a proper replacement for a indefinite while to come, with some reports saying that the [737MAX crisis is getting worse and worse will continue for years.](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/17/business/boeing-737-max-outlook/index.html)

Sad for 737 enthusiasts that both 737 variants are going to be cut (for now) and in January, Boeing’s 737 production lines will be completely empty. Boeing’s commercial production line will only consist of 747-8s, 777s and 787s.

Boeing was hoping for the 737 MAX to sell like hot cakes and the 777X taking off by the end of 2020 so they could get on developing the 797 by 2020. [Unfortunately, it looks like the 797 has been heavily ignored by Boeing in recent months due to the escalating 737 MAX crisis.](https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2019/12/03/boeings-nma-outlook-unclear-as-focus-remains-on.html)",/r/boeing/comments/ecami0/big_fat_news_week_for_boeing_737_max_halted_last/

boeing,"Folks:

I used to work at Boeing (Boeing Computer Services in Bellevue, Washington back in the 1990's). I am now retired having completed a career from 2004 to 2016 at Intel in Hillsboro, Oregon.

Up until now, I had weird dreams of working at Intel, consisting of mostly realizing that I was running around Intel Oregon's hallways nude and trying to find my bedroom or clothing, but that was a post at r/intel which resolved to being insecure at work at Intel. Those happened years ago.

Up to now, I had absolutely no dreams of working at Boeing. This last week, however, the floodgates seemed to have opened up. And the flavor is very different.

No, I am not nude nor embarrassed. I am simply lost in a maze.

I am at my desk, but the office changes. I get up to go to the cafeteria, but instead of the cafeteria, I end up outdoors. The buildings face a desolate landscape of other buildings that are clearly abandoned. There is silence except for sounds of nature. No man made sounds.

I need to go back inside, but I forgot my badge so I knew that the electronic security doors would not work.

But, as I approach, the building I left, the building is different. The gate is closed, but the gap between the gate itself and the rest of the fence is so wide that not only could I squeeze through, I could piroulett through as if I am dancing in a ballet. 

When I got to the door of the building, the lock was open and dissassembled. I was able to push the latch back and open the door. No alarms go off, no on challenged me. In fact, there was no one in the building.

Machines are running. Computers are outputting tons of data. But there were no people. I walk to a manager's desk to try to look up on the computer where I am supposed to be. The computer keeps outputting peoples names but not my own.

Finally, someone walks up to me and says 'May I help you find you?' I explain to him that I am lost and I might be punished if I can't find my office.

He leads me outside, but dissapears when we had to walk through a puddle. He says that the pumps are broken and he must leave.

I end up at a bus station, but that mutates into a corridor of old dusty cubicles but no people. The lights start to dim. The hallway turns into a subway station, but there were no people, no one collecting money, and all of the locks were broken everywhere.

I see mom on the train, but it was going away.

I wake up.

Totally weird. Not threatening, not scary, not embarassing, unlike being naked at Intel.

What gives?

Background: 

I interned at Northrop for two summers and I like it a lot, however with LA traffic, it is almost a 2 hours commute. Boeing’s commute to Huntington Beach is going to be 30-45 mins at best. It’s in their Huntington Beach facility for a mechanical engineer position.

However Northrop Grumman is thriving and become one of Boeing’s biggest competitions. I really like my job at Northrop but the commute is taking a toll on me. I can’t move closer because of personal reasons.

&gt; A production system, where Boeing transfers risks to its supply chain, has backfired as core elements in the supply chain coped with an inability to scale up production or deliver products from the desired quality standard in time.

&gt; This led to Boeing building up deferred costs at a much faster pace and much higher than it had ever anticipated and teething problems after service entry did not make things better for the Dreamliner program.

boeing,"Why are RS-25 used? They are so expensive, in my understanding, to achieve the traits that they won't need as an expendable booster's main engines. Being reusable - they are thrown away after each flight. Being both atmosphere and space efficient - they will only operate in atmosphere so they don't need the complex nozzle.

I don't understand why RS-25 are used and not for example RS-68. They are two times cheaper, have similar atmosphere isp and are almost twice as powerful so only 2-3 would be required. They are currently used so there's no need to develop any new technology.

boeing,"Many years ago I bought a whole bunch of aircraft parts online including this air conditioning control panel taken from N474EV and when I did little research I discovered it was actually the 4th 747 built and was part of the test program before being delivered to Pan Am as N731PA.

I was wondering if anyone is able to confirm if this part is original and was in the aircraft when it was built.

Here are two photographs showing the panel front and back...

[https://imgur.com/a/LYVps81](https://imgur.com/a/LYVps81)  
[https://imgur.com/a/sKockdZ](https://imgur.com/a/sKockdZ)

Looking at the back there seems to be date below the part number which says 10-16-68 for which I take it as 16th October 1968, am I reading this right or is this not a date? Also of note on the front of the panel Zone 4 seems to be rubbed out and covered up which suggests that it was in the aircraft before being converted to a freighter in the 90s as there would be no need to air condition Zone 4 if it was only freight.

My current job is decent, but I'm a contractor. I get:

1 week of PTO per year

1 week of sick time per year

10 paid holidays per yer

I pay almost $200/month for very basic, catastrophic-like health insurance (for just myself, no other family members)

I make a couple dollars more per hour than what I would be starting at with Boeing, but raises now are VERY, VERY rare, so my wage has been pretty much stagnant for the few years I've been here

One good thing about my current job is that they're pretty flexible when I have appointments or family emergencies or whatever to attend to. Not sure how Boeing compares in this regard.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really like to know how all these things compare to Boeing, but above all my concern is about being laid off. My current job is pretty stable and secure.

boeing,"Hey folks. So this sub has not really been moderated until this year and we definitely need to clean up the guidelines to make it a bit clearer. Just making a quick notice for a common trend we have been seeing.

Posting video links is fine. Just refrain from overdoing it that you are reposting the same video; which will be viewed as spam. The other issue with a recently removed user is using throwaway to pretend you're a ""fan"" of your own channel.

The other post issue does have to do with the 737 max 8 topic. A civil discussion is fine. You may notice (or not) that majority 737 max 8 posts are deleted quickly but some do remain up. The ones that are being removed are posts with inflammatory titles or are done by users who have a history of using the very topic to troll our users.

For non-Boeing employees/contractors, you are welcome to start **civil discussions** with legitimate questions. Just please do keep in mind that Boeing is a large company with many projects. Details regarding a specific project is kept internal within the respective team. I wouldn't be surprised if we don't have regular users that are involved with the 737 max 8, let alone one that had anything to do with the current testing.

Also project details are limited to small group of people that it can be very easy to narrow down a user to a specific person. There are probably many details that Engineers on the 737 Max 8 would love to share to dispel most media coverage but are unable to do so.

Many of you are also doing a great job of reporting a lot of the aforementioned posts and I thank you for that. Thank you all for your time and being a member of this community.

boeing,"I got interviewed for this engineer position in organization ""A"" in Everett,WA back in April, and made to the salary negotiation step.. However, Boeing thankfully paused the hiring process all of a sudden due to reorganization. I completely forgot about it and let it go. Then about a week ago, after a long,long wait of 5 months, I got an email from a hiring manager ""X"" (a different one than I had got initially interviewed with, manager ""Y"") that they are looking for people in organization ""A"" again. He told me to apply and let him know once I submit my application. Manger ""Y"" was also CC'd in the email too.

Of course I did it right away and let both manger ""X"" and ""Y"" know. However, no reply so far after a week. I thought I would get a fast response as I assume this is a resumed hiring process and the manager directly contacted me. Am I just being too anxious and hopeful?? I guess so. Another thing is that when I applied, I indicated that this is through the referral of manager ""Y"" because he was the one who initially interviewed me in April, but not sure if that has killed my chance. 

I am thinking about following up maybe next week but just wanted to share plus seek an opinion from Boeing gurus whether a resumed hiring process at Boeing means you simply re-apply and go through the whole interview steps again.

boeing,"So long story short,

My career had a major turn around after I was a caregiver for 6 months  and still part time monitoring, for my mother who has had a bone marrow transplant. I had time to reflect had developed different interests of a career to pursue. I have lots of mechanical experience and work at the Boeing company in the past and have been waiting 14 months to get a position back at the company and recently got an email for an interview. I also have learned that in the past never to wait around for Boeing to get back to you in a timely manner, I had an interview for another position six months ago with no call back.

For a month-and-a-half after transitioning from being a caregiver for my mother, I was offered a technician job at a local Volkswagen dealership in Everett Washington. It isn't as good as I thought it would be for the fact that my opinion is flat rate is crippling the auto mechanic industry in some ways.

Last Sunday I got a email from Tesla offering an interview for a paid internship at the Tesla start program in shoreline community college. Tesla offers all the tools, full benefits and company stock upon graduation and job placement. 

What do I do? Do I pursue a new and exciting career with Tesla? Do I keep my fingers crossed and hope my Boeing interview is scheduled soon? It's been two weeks since they have reached out to me and would like to schedule an interview.

boeing,"I just finished my first year at Boeing in an engineering role. I'd like to switch positions because I want to explore as many different areas of Boeing as possible in my early career so I know what I want to specialize in when I go back to get an advanced degree (planning on that for 4 years from now). A rotation honestly sounds ideal. However, I was wondering if switching to a different role before getting my Level 2 means that I ""reset"" all of my progress since I will be learning a new role. Also, if I get a Level 2 in this role, will it transfer over to my next role, or is it highly dependent on proficiency in my new skill?",/r/boeing/comments/d0nb29/does_switching_engineering_jobs_set_you_back_for/
boeing,"How do other departments seem to handle promotions at Boeing? At my department, we are rather small, and when there is a manager position or even sometimes a P level available they either do a no post when they want someone already in the department or if they don’t want someone internally they do an external post. They encourage internals to apply for these postings but it ALWAYS goes to an external candidate. It’s really disappointing because all of us P levels know this is how it works so it’s like why even apply? We feel like we aren’t respected and it’s a bit of a slap in the face when most of us have to then train our new manager. I’m so fed up about it that I’m going to try to get a new job and so are many of my colleagues throughout the country. Leadership doesn’t seem to notice or care about the turnover in our positions or that this is why. I think leaving Boeing at this point seems like the option for most of us and we are all really good and capable workers. For example, I’ve been with the company 4 years and am a level 4. I’m always scored well as well and hear I do amazing at my job. I’m at a loss of what to do now because my manager is leaving and I get the feeling I’m not even being considered even though there are only the two of us at our site. So they’ll likely bring in an outside person I will have to train on a lot of things who will oversee me and one other colleague at another site who also is wondering why I’m not the obvious choice. It just seems like such a messed up culture to never promote from within and after seeing a colleague at another state go through this where she worked in her role for 15 years, then a manager position was being created in her state, she interviewed and didn’t get it... then she trained her new manager...

boeing,"Hi, I was hoping someone on here might help me talk out my career plans. 

I have a bachelor's degree in environmental science and am currently working assembly on the floor. It's ok but I'm finding myself bored and tired of the mindless repetitiveness. 

I've hoping to move towards a job that will challenge me and give me opportunities to use my education or perform problem-solving.  Unfortunately I haven't seen any entry-level environmental testing/safety jobs in the last 6 months. I've also applied to a few entry-level engineering jobs (thoughts on industrial engineers or QA specialists?) but have yet to even get an interview. Even though I have my foot in the door with Boeing, do I even stand a chance competing against people with direct experience and/or degrees in that area?

I'd like to take advantage of earning a master's with the LTP program but I'm having a hard time narrowing it down. I know I want to study something that will be more employable than my environmental science degree was. I'm intrigued by engineering but also acknowledge that while I killed it in biology/chemistry, calculus was a struggle for me. Would a master's in engineering be extremely math heavy or do you cover most of that in undergrad? I imagine I'd have to take quite a few pre-reqs....   

I'd love to hear people's thoughts on specific master's as a jumping off point for my research.

boeing,"I am a SPEEA represented engineer working in Everett. I have been having a discussion about level upgrade with my manager since the beginning of this year. In general she has been dragging her feet on every step of the process and I have had to push her to each next step. Finally at my interim PM she told me the decision had been made to grant my upgrade and that she just needed to determine the effective date and salary adjustment which she planned to do the following week. It has been nearly two months since the decision was made, but the upgrade has still not gone through. My manager claims this is due to ""a snag in Workday"" but hasn't provided any details or timeframe for resolution. I am still relatively new to the company (\~1.5 years) and this is my first level upgrade so I am not very familiar with this process. 

What are my options? Should I take this to my Senior Manager or HR and ask for help getting the upgrade through? I've also considered asking SPEEA for help since based on the SJC tasks and my ETS records, I can prove that 70%+ of my time has gone toward higher-level work for over 1 year.  

To complicate matters I am planning on leaving my position in the next few months because my wife accepted a new job offer that will have us leaving Washington. I'm in job hunting mode but not sure when I will be leaving my position. It seems that the common advice is to not provide any notice to your current employer until you have a firm offer in hand (to avoid potentially being let go before you intend to leave).

I was told today by the person I interviewed with that they did the final sign off earlier this week and that I should have an offer coming in mid next week. When I applied for this position, it didn't mention a ""level"" (1 or 2) for the position. I am just curious what I should *expect* the salary to be for a position like this. I can no longer see the job posting, I believe that the requirements were a B.S degree &amp; 2+ years of experience.

boeing,"If you are learning **[TIG welding](http://www.danscertifiedwelding.com/tig-welding)** strategies or are just trying to be a TIG welder, the last point that needs to come near speed is the hand feeding the rod. In kindergarten, most of us discovered the best ways to hold a huge pastel and also this is not too different from holding a TIG lantern.

If the hand that feeds the filler pole is a bit of a slow-moving learner, a really thin glove helps. If you’re having issues really feeling the wire, attempt mechanical gloves or woven cotton hand-wear covers. Below are a lot more techniques as well as ideas to help you out.

TIG Welding Techniques
======================

### Pick the Right-Size TIG Welding Pole

For sheet metal approximately 1/8-inch thick, do not utilize a welding pole bigger than the density of the metal you’re _[welding](http://www.danscertifiedwelding.com)_. The amperage is reduced as well as the weld puddle should be little to stop blowing a hole.

When you dip the pole right into the puddle, the rod draws the warm from the pool, making it tough to preserve a consistent dimension bead. It is best that newbies need to not exercise with slim metal.

### TIG Lantern Handle Should be 10 Levels or Less

Ideally, the torch angle should just determine around 10 levels or less. If you have too much lantern angle, the warmth will certainly be deflected and also the pole will certainly melt even before you get involved in the puddle.

This will certainly trigger the rod to ball up as well as blog into the puddle. You wish to slip the filler rod right into the pool so you get a regular bead. Exemptions to this consist of when you’re using an ordinary cord technique and also are leaning the torch back while you stroll the cup.

### Never ever Let a Sphere Type at the Rod End

If this takes place, you are doing glitch. It could be because, you are looking an arc that’s also long, excessive torch angle, bad filler pole angle, inadequate amperage or a mix of these points.

One of the most common of these among newbies are utilizing too much torch angle as well as well long an arc. A long arc implies warm is not concentrated as well as you get this huge heated arc plume like you would get with a gas soldering iron.

TIG Welding Refine
------------------

### Thoriated Tungsten Electrodes are Contaminated

Many individuals state 2% thoriated tungsten electrodes are gently contaminated, however 2% lanthanated electrodes are just as excellent as 2% thoriated. So if you are frightened if thoriated tungsten yet you are much more scared of crappy electrodes that don’t work as well, usage 2% lanthanated (they are tinted blue).

Bear in mind that the blue ones are not brittle like 2% thoriated electrodes. Additionally, they splinter if you attempt to damage them or trim with dykes.

Safety Information Cards have caused Southwest Airlines no end of strife with nervous fliers ""bombarding"" flight attendants with questions if they were on the design flawed aircraft.

Buying into the (incorrect) Boeing sales pitch to airline companies that Pilots do not need any Simulator time and merely need a 50 minute iPad course on the *new and improved* 737, Boeing also had a combined Safety Information Card rolled out to ~~suckers~~ airline companies who bought the plane.

This backfired recently on Southwest Airlines, who is the largest user of the very safe and reliable 737 but also has 34 of the 737-Max aircraft which have caused two crashes recently by overriding all Pilot instruction and flying headfirst into Terra Firma killing all on board.

To date, nobody has survived a 737-Max crash.

Southwest Airlines had been sold an improved aircraft so went ahead with the plan to have a combined 737 and 737-Max Safety Information Card.   This backfired spectacularly when nervous passengers thought they were on the doomed aircraft.   Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok users all sent questions ranging from calm to near hysterical upon finding a 737-Max safety card in the seat back pocket.

Rather than blame foreign pilots (Boeing) or work with Europe, Brazil and Canada to approve a solution (FAA) Southwest immediately......................**and quietly** printed new Safety Information Cards with the 737-MAX removed.

boeing,"$185 Million is what AA is claiming in lost revenue.   The cancelled flights, the grounding of aircraft, the storage of these design-flawed clunkers, the bookings goint to airlines that fly reliable planes................all added up to $185 in an income miss for AA.

Now, AA may have shaded these numbers a bit hoping to get either a discount on future planes or some compensation from Boeing and the whole announcement cheerily deflects/ignores their own fight to the death with their mechanics union who are grounding flights intentionally for made up reasons to pressure AA into signing a new deal.   Personally I feel AA's problems are their own internal one's and the 737-Max is a great example of never missing an opportunity blame some else............anyone else.

However, it must be said that AA has said they are cancelling 115 flights a day because of the poorly designed 737-Max and it's infamous MCAS system.  

http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2019/The-Latest-Information-About-737-MAX-Operations/default.aspx

The real alarm bells for Boeing should be............AA only has 24 planes!!!!  Twenty Four of these POS aircraft that catapult innocent passengers and crew into the ground all notwithstanding the brave efforts of the Flight Crew.     24 planes has (as per AA's description) caused a $185 dollar hit to the bottom line.

United ordered 100 of these aircraft previously. 
https://www.boeing.com/commercial/customers/united-airlines/historic-order-of-100-737-maxs-and-50-next-generation-737s.page

Alaska Airlines has one imminently awaiting delivery and already painted (I cannot prove this but know it)

..........and poor Southwest.   Poor Southwest has 34 Max's sitting around some tarmac gathering dust while rivals with air worthiness certificates fly passengers all over the country/world.



There are 371 737-Max's that have been delivered to ~~suckers~~ airlines around the world.   Let us say, just for the sake of argument that AA is correct and we will use really loose math here.     24 737-MAX planes that AA have make up 6% of the worlds fleet.     Using AA math that means airlines have lost $1.96 **BILLION** in revenue.

Now, to be fair, a large amount of that $1.96 Billion will go to other airlines who didn't buy a 737-Max, but if you think the airlines that lost out on that revenue care that another airline simply soaked up that revenue..........you are right.  They will care.  They will care a lot.

Boeing may or may not have $1.96 Billion sitting in a slush fund waiting to pay back airline companies.   But that number is for Q2.   Q2 is over, we are already in Q3.   This compound math is becoming a big problem.   Don't forget someone is going to be looking at compensation for the deaths of 346 people.

There will be a lot of cost cutting coming due to heavy, heavy discounts, payouts and fees.

In my humble opinion, Boeing's biggest problem comes from the fact that the FAA has (for reasons which have not been satisfactorily explained to me) agreed to work with the EASA to certify the aircraft.   Now the FAA already has agreements with the Brazilian and Canadian air safety agencies.   This was due to Brazil building Embraer and Canada building Bombardier and entering into a shared rules agreement with Canada.    The long and the short of it is the US and Canada adopt the same rules.  An iconoclast would say that Canada gets the full intelligence and mechanism of the FAA without the costs but so be it.

I recently applied to the ITCFP internal requisition about a week ago. I have a couple of questions regarding the application and interview process as well as the pay range and specifics of the program.

1). How long does the application/interview phase take? I will be returning to my university at the end of this summer and I’m wondering if I’ll know whether I got the position before the end of my internship.

2). Do you just apply online and they select from there or is there an in-person/WebEx interview as well? 

3). The pay grade listed on SJCS lists the pay in very odd, huge ranges compared to other Comp charts. Does ITCFP follow the general Boeing trend of paying recent college grads somewhere around .75-.85 of the mid value for that specific location?

This speaks more to the corporate mismanagement of this whole situation rather than the plane itself as the plane has been grounded since March.    FlyaDeal operates in the most pro-US jurisdiction in the Arab world and is very pro Boeing.

...............we need to figure this out.  Many of you have sent me and other posters who point out the inadequices of the handling of this situation as trolls or s***-disturbers.    We cannot simply circle the wagons and hope the problem goes away.  It is not going away.  This plane has a design flaw.   Larger engines are situated on a different position on the wing, the $9 dollar an hour coders can write all the programs they want but the MCAS, in fact the entire flight command needs work.    We have to do better.    

This is starting to circle the drain here.   We need to get on top of this.   All the software updates, the reboots and the warm assurances from top level management cannot overlook the fact the company is silo'ed.

boeing,"Tajikistan's Somon Air has ~~walked~~ run away from plans to lease the 737 Max.   Concern about the timeline to re-entry of service, shattered public confidence in the model and fears of seeing its crew and customers plummet head first into the ground, plagured Somon Air.

The 737MAX was due to be leased from Air Lease Corp and should have already been ferrying passengers around the Somon Air network.   The airline was the main competitor to Tajik Air and had a fairly good safety record with air worthiness certificates for 13 countries and the EU.

Boeing has struggled to regain confidence after growing concerns about how it downplayed the severity of the problem, lobbied the US government to allow to keep flying and blaming foreign pilots for crashes they could not avoid.

This follows Garuda (Lion Air's largest competitor) and Azerbaijan Airlines walking away from the troubled aircraft.  


Meanwhile the FAA continues to work with regulators from around the world after conceding defeat in their ability to police or sign off on the work needed to get the 737MAX flying again.    Europe, China, Australia, Canada and Brazil are assisting the FAA in examining the the disastrous MCAS system that Boeing didn't train Pilots for or put in the Flight Manual.    Boeing continues to insist a fine tuning of the MCAS system is all that is needed despite two deadly crashes in 5 months, the discovery of problems with the lead edge slat tracks having cracks and further problems with the MCAS system.

Let me repeat.   The software ""fix"" is not a fix at all.   It has failed.    Boeing test pilots almost crashed three times recently.   All were aware of the issue and were on the lookout for it

1- Notwithstanding the 'fix' a 737-MAX MCAS system engaged near Port Angeles and pitched downwards.    YYJ was contacted as an emergency.

2 - Notwithstanding the 'fix' a 737-MAX MCAS system engaged over Chehalis/Centralia and took considerable manoevers and pilot engagement to recover.   The Pilots needed to switch off all systems and truly fly manual as the software **did not engage as expected**

3 - A Boeing 737-MAX test flight, flown out of Renton Municipal overrode all inputs and dramatically pitched downwards.  The Software ""fix"" didn't fix anything.

She wrote that I should reply to her with my selection along with which form of identification I'll use for I-9 paperwork. I replied 20 minutes after I received the email.....

The first week post offer, I received a bunch of paper work (background check, drug screen etc.) regarding my contingencies. I completed everything in a timely manner and then I was left in the dark for about 5 weeks....

My ""recruiter"" would not communicate with me at all despite me trying to contact him multiple times via email and phone. After 5 weeks and  absolutely nothing from my recruiter, I ended up contacting the woman from global staffing who set up my drug screen for an update. She then tells me my start date is on June 28th....two weeks from now. 

As you may know, the welcome letter states to not put in a two week notice at current job, or adjust living arrangements until the recruiter tells you that all the contingencies are cleared. Thankfully my offer includes moving assistance, so at least that will be taken care of. But, needless to say, I was not prepared for this process to go this way. 

I did not have my hiring managers contact info until this week. This whole time I thought something was very wrong; either I didn't pass my background check, hiring freeze due to the max situation, etc.  I discussed this with my hiring manager and she is aware that it is not my fault but I still need to report on the 28th.

boeing,"How long does it typically take to hit level 2 if you're hired fresh out of college?  

I know the usual figure is 2 years but I'm wondering if anyone's done it sooner, perhaps maybe even in a year. The reason I ask is because I've been given a lot of opportunities on this particular team (mostly due to it being a newer team without significant structures/processes in place) to perform at a level 2 function for the past 1-2 months (been here 5) and according to several of my coworkers and my PO, I've taken really good advantage of them and have been performing at a particularly high level for a new hire in the time since I started. I don't think I could have made this much progress on a normally structured team or even with a different statement of work, but I've found the challenges we have to be pretty exciting and I haven't been afraid to put in quite a bit of overtime as well (which my boss has gone out of his way to let me know he appreciates very much). Besides the normal stuff of being quick to learn, a good presence in the office, taking on more responsibilities as they come up, etc.  

I want to approach my boss with this question/proposal at a tagup meeting in a few weeks but I want to be sure I'm not talking out of my ass if I make my stance known to him. I should add that I've been taking careful notes of my performance every other week or so and how specifically they align to the level 2 functions in SJCS, and I've also worked hard to work an impactful side project outside of our specific team that caught the attention of our second level manager and her team - she's working directly with me and a fellow new hire to implement our ideas at the organization level and as a result I have a very solid relationship with her and the rest of the first line managers underneath her in our org. I feel like a have a fairly strong case to present for him as we continue with the year, but I'm hoping someone in the comments can give me their own personal experience so I have additional perspectives beyond my own team, or hopefully I get a nice cold dose of reality to bring me back down to earth. Or maybe someone can give me positive news. Either way works :)

I'll be attending orientation for new hires on 6/21 in Seattle.

As such, I'm curious to know what is the general dress code? To note, I am a female.

I have a lot of stretchy leggings that I've used in my warehouse jobs in the past as my jeans kept snagging and tearing on me, but are those acceptable to wear in this type of job?

Also, what recommendations for footwear?

I see the 787 was once called 7E7. So my question is, did the aircraft ever sell, and operate under 7E7, before changing its name? And what was the difference between the two? Or did Boeing change the name before releasing the aircraft? Also, I’m trying to look at cockpit photos, surely Boeing didn’t make the 787 cockpit the same the first year they sold vs to what’s being sold today? Correct? 

One last question, let’s say I own an airline, and I’m making an order through Boeing on a 787. Could I request a total cockpit change on the aircrafts? For example could I tell them I like the 787 except the cockpit, maybe arrange the 777 cockpit into my 787s?",/r/boeing/comments/bz20hu/boeing_7e7_vs_787/

boeing,"My friend and I did some quick calculations the other day after hearing for the nth time that ""oh I have a friend who works at Amazon and he makes like $120k.""  

We actually came to a pretty cool conclusion based on the fact that most workers on Amazon are working on average 50 hour weeks (perhaps more but let's assume 50).  

If you're in SPEEA and you're an entry level engineer making $78,000 (which is about the average) and you work 10 hours of overtime each week, given that SPEEA workers have no 'gate' hours and overtime pay is time + $6.50, **that actually will bump up your annual salary to $100,880** as an entry level engineer, which is kind of crazy.  

Of course this rests on the assumption that you're in SPEEA and your department is actually able to approve you for 10 hours of overtime every week, but this is a cool thought experiment nonetheless and it's fun to tell your friends that you would be making 6 figures if you worked similar schedules to Amazon or Microsoft.",/r/boeing/comments/bw6n1w/a_quick_note_on_puget_sound_area_engineering/

so, i’m going into my last year of high school, and spent a good majority of my junior year going on trips to see schools and jobs. i go to an alternative school, so we had more options for trades and union type work. 
on one of the trips, we went to a local community college that has a bunch of sincerely amazing engineering and automotive programs. one of which, was their boeing program. 
i’ve been interested in working there since i was a kid, a lot of my friends dads and my family worked for boeing for generations.

&amp;#x200B;

I had a structured phone interview exactly one week ago for an entry level engineering position in Washington, typical format, 5 behavioral, overall I think it went very well.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked what the next steps were and they said I'd hopefully hear back next week. Well, this week has come and gone and I know it was optimistic thinking they would get back to me that fast given the holiday weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

The same day as my interview (Friday) Taleo went from under consideration to interview completed, it was then updated again on Tuesday and one more time on Wednesday. From looking at this subreddit this seems like it is a good sign? The only downfall is this job explicitly says no relocation offered, non negotiable. I live in the midwest so I am wondering if anyone has been able to change their mind on this. I realize it is an entry level position and I don't have a lot of negotiating power but the job is for a very specific division that I had experience with in college.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read the interim report on Ethiopian 302 very carefully. I have studied the data in the report. The facts, such as we have at this point, are clear: there was a runaway trim situation arising shortly after takeoff due to a faulty AOA sensor.

&amp;#x200B;

The flight crew had a complete and correct memory checklist for this situation in the flight manual. They had an additional bulletin prepared after Lion Air 610. Both of these described precisely the situation encountered by the pilots.

&amp;#x200B;

While dealing with this problem, the pilots discontinued their climb and levelled off, but they did not retard the throttles from takeoff power. In consequence, the aircraft experienced an overspeed in the range of 50kts for approximately the last 2.5 minutes of flight.

&amp;#x200B;

The pilots eventually disabled the electric trim, but they had trouble controlling the aircraft manually because of excessive control forces. They were either unable to set the trim manually due to aerodynamic forces from the overspeed, or else they were not sufficiently aggressive in setting the trim manually.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly before the end of the flight, they re-enabled the electric trim despite the checklist specifically saying not to do so. The MCAS was then able to direct the electric trim to the full AND position. This was a terminal event because of the overspeed.

&amp;#x200B;

This clear and factual narrative was flatly and unsupportably contradicted by the conclusion of the preliminary report, which can only represent a CYA move.

&amp;#x200B;

Any properly-trained pilot should be able to overcome a single component failure when an effective memory checklist and a recent specific AD or bulletin is available. There was time, opportunity, altitude and airspace to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

I can therefore think of only two reasons for the tidal wave of FUD aimed at Boeing by the media:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) There are no ethical fact-based journalists left and they are all making up stories for maximum shock value and as click bait; or

&amp;#x200B;

(2) The Russian troll factory in St. Petersburg has been given orders to attack Boeing in order to destabilize NATO.

And of course to negotiate before signing right? I am aware that living in OKC isn’t very expensive and this is an entry position.

Relocation wise, is it best for me to email recruiter for an exact amount that they’re willing to reimburse? How was your relocation like when you had to go through it? I am moving from the bay area. Do I do drug test here at the bay area or they wait until I am in OKC? So lost! Please provide me with guidance fellow Boeing friends! Please let me know if more information is needed!

boeing,"I watched a documentary about the DC-10 a while ago, and remember that it was grounded for a month or so in 1979. The DC-10 was grounded due to a single crash that was caused by poor maintenance. Back in 1979, there was no internet, and I'm assuming information about the plane didn't spread as much as with the internet. However, it does seem like the incident did tarnish the image of McDonnell-Douglas and trijets altogether. 

So with that in mind, is the 737 MAX grounding worse than the DC-10 grounding in 1979? And will it leave a worse impression of the 737 in the future?

From my understanding, since we do have the internet, and more advanced technology, more people have heard about the 737 MAX crashes. The 737 MAX crashed because of a big design error, and not a maintenance issue. The media said that the cause of the bad design fault was because of profit being more important than safety, in the competition with the A320NEO. Also, the DC-10 was rebranded as the MD-11 when they designed the successor variant to the DC-10; but the MD-11 still didn't sell very well. I suspect that Boeing may have to let go of the 1960s 737 brand and plane, and will need to come up with a completely modernized and new design for a 737 replacement after the MAX.

I thought I'd drop some advice that nobody asked for! Hope this sets some of you up for success; or something to look forward to if you are starting in the next couple weeks (Looking at you Quarter system interns).

**Attend social/networking event**
Most common ones will be the ones that are organized by your intern coordinator. I still have a lot of connection that I made during my internships and despite all of us spreading out to different sites, we still keep in touch and make time to see each other when we can. Also these events have tons of free food.

Boeing also has an organization called REACH, which provides social gathering for young employees. These are open to interns as well and great place to network with other Boeing employees. There are tons of lunch and learns and community volunteer events as well.

**Be ambitious! Reach out!**
Boeing greatly values the intern program. Dennis Muilenburg (CEO) and many managers and technical fellows at Boeing were interns themselves. You would be surprised by how many people are willing to help you out.

In my example, during my first internship, I established connection with various managers, technical fellows, and executives just simply by sending a pleasant e-mail and asking for an interview. In the case of the exec, he scheduled and sent me the meeting request himself!

**Use Insite**
Boeing has an internal directory and social website called ""Insite"". Use it to find and contact people you are interested in talking to. This is also where you can sign up for newsletter, join groups, and see upcoming events.

**Don't be afraid to mess up and ask questions**
""Impostor Syndrome"" is a very common thing, and is especially true for Engineer interns. Just keep in mind that no intern really knows what they are doing, and nobody expects you to know much. Your technical mentor is there to help you learn the job, and don't be afraid of looking stupid. Tech mentors are typically fairly new hires and sometimes prior interns themselves; they know what you are going through.",/r/boeing/comments/bn9a08/so_its_intern_season/

My benefits are changing greatly and I am so grateful. Yet this is making problems with my coworkers and friends as the Russian community and Boeing’s Russian community is a family as well. 

My husband has made some great mistakes but I love him. Yet he’s lied about many things and I am in fear of his past and not being honest may have me deported. He has told some people who don’t like him the baby is not his biological child and I am not going to discuss anything else in regards to my child. He has lied about our life and it’s causing me stress because of his  cheating while we married until recently and we never told his family here about the marriage and very few people who are Americans who know him. His ex and other child’s mother is who he had been cheating with and she never knew until she caught him and told his parents. He now has a lot of legal issues but is a lawyer and she is going to tell immigration we are sure. She also has all the lies he told her that she believed.

received email to set up interview- early April

&amp;#x200B;

The status on my Taleo page said ""under consideration"" since the moment I submitted my application.  My interview went well, it lasted about an hour and 10 minutes approx. Asked the hiring manager when would I  hear back, and he said that they would most likely send me an offer ""as soon as possible."" It's been 3 weeks now and havent heard anything. I sent a follow-up email after 2 weeks and change; no response.  My Taleo status changed to ""interview completed"" a couple days ago, so at least I know they are actually doing SOMETHING, and if they were no longer interested they would just have sent that dreaded  "" Unfortunately you weren’t selected for this role"" email. 

What do you all think?  Does the taleo status change mean something positive? The anxiety is torturing me, I've been refreshing the taleo page every 10 minutes in hope of any change . Any comments, suggestions, similar experiences, words of encouragement are welcome. Thanks for taking the time to read this and have an awesome day!",/r/boeing/comments/biqs1s/interview_completed_status/

boeing," **Boeing 737 Max:**

&amp;#x200B;

The issues with the 737 Max is not exactly to do with the placement of the Engine or rather the Software itself (Let me explain the software bit in the explanation) and or even, the pilot's that drive them or anything other than the business that you may think is the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

**I got people saying the following:**

&amp;#x200B;

* The issue is the software; Software has too high of a chance of failure and Boeing should rely on their pilots rather than software.
* The issue is the pilots; Software has a low chance of failure and Boeing should not fully rely on human correction.
* The issue is the Engine placement; The Engine is too high for the 737 Max to fly properly.
* The issue is the Wings; The wings do not function properly so that's why where the engine is it causes the nose to raise too much.
* So on so forth

&amp;#x200B;

**The \*REAL\* issue with the 737 Max:**

&amp;#x200B;

The real issue does not lie on anything above or even fully on the software. If Boeing gave adequate time to conduct full extensive testing of the software along with putting together an entire (100% ideal) training program things would have turned out much differently.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, they decided to cut corners to get the quick cash, which in turn caused lives and even money. If they learned one thing from this I hope it is that cutting corners to earn cash can easily do the opposing of what is intended.

&amp;#x200B;

Software is not a dangerous thing if you don't allow it to be, in other words; If you fully debug and take out the kinks (To the best of human ability) you will have a much safer flight that does not rely fully on pilot's; pilot's are human and humans make mistakes. The software will work as intended for the most part as long as you did your appropriate amount of debugging and testing. I will say however that yes, software can mess up and it at times can be of issue, but this is far and in between in comparison to human error if you did like I said many times adequate testing and debugging.

&amp;#x200B;

I would never say software is without a doubt bug free or even fully reliable, but I will confidently say that software is absolutely without a doubt more reliable than human's. If you give appropriate time to debug/flush out error's/kinks in the program/software you will in return have a more adequate and safer option to rely on then having the pilot to rely on.

&amp;#x200B;

The blame also does not fully lie on Boeing, I know they are the ones to rush the release of the 737 Max but they also had it inspected and the FAA should have checked everything to make sure it is up for the task; people's lives are at stake and that should not be taken lightly.

&amp;#x200B;

***NOTE: Boeing and FAA cut corners to get the 737 Max into service before deadly crashes. In other words, the FAA also has reason to be blamed.***

&amp;#x200B;

**NEVER CUT CORNERS WHEN PEOPLE'S AND FAMILIES ARE AT STAKE, KILLING ONE PERSON DOES NOT ONLY AFFECT THAT PERSON BUT A FAMILY. IN THIS CASE HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES!**

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: I know I said kink's, debug, rely, safer and etc. often, but this is the best way to explain to you.

&amp;#x200B;

**NOTE:**

&amp;#x200B;

Just remember relying on a human is not the best means of safety, if you wish to have the most safe and secure way of doing things software is the way to go... but NEVER do the following.

&amp;#x200B;

* Rush Software
* Rush Training Procedures
* Rush Testing
* ETC

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

&amp;#x200B;

The issue lies on Boeing rushing out the plane to compete with their rivals (Airbus) and the FAA for allowing Boeing and themselves to cut corners. The issues does not lie on the software or even Engine Placement the reason it does not is because with adequate time for testing you would be able to adjust for that change either by software or by changes to the plane as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

Software is something of which people use due to the amount of added safety software can give that human's can not. If you do not give adequate time to test the software that entire aspect of the software being safe can be an absolute disaster.

If you feel I missed something or said something that may be wrong and or worded weirdly feel free to discuss that in the comments, I am open to change the post if other's take something in a way I did not intend on saying.

&amp;#x200B;

I am open for discussion and debate, I am open minded on almost if not all matters; feel free to voice your opinion. I am however going to say Boeing and the FAA should be reliable for everything that happened and there should be something put in place to prevent such a thing from happening again.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep note, I am not the best writer so I may have made mistakes in grammar, I am sorry about that. I hope you all find this useful and I hope that Boeing learned from their mistake and will do everything to prevent this from happening again! I am also sorry if I completely misunderstood or got something all wrong, I will absolutely change any errors/mistakes in this post if one is reported.",/r/boeing/comments/bh3i1h/from_a_software_engineer_to_those_not/

I should start by saying this is a throw away account of course. Here is my situation. I applied at the end of March for a contract position at Boeing. I was called on Wednesday April 3rd to schedule a phone interview for the following day, Thursday April 4th. I used marijuana frequently (at night) and my last time using it was on April 3rd when I got the call.  

I got a call yesterday from the recruiter saying  that I am still under consideration and they will be giving out offers mid next week which I think is a good sign because why else would they call to tell me that, right? 

I am excited and shocked that they are going to give out offers without any in person interviews and potentially so fast. Obviously I stopped using marijuana and am working out a lot and drinking a lot of water to try and flush the THC out of my system Incase I do get an offer.

My question is, they never talked about pay, length of the contract, if it is a contract to hire position, etc. I kind of was taken back at how fast they were moving given everything I’ve read on their timeframe. 

If I do get an offer next week, can I request one week to review the offer (to have more clean days to get the THC out of my system), or does Boeing require a drug test within two days of an offer?

boeing,"Why did that Boeing crash? Trust me, Boeing is well aware of why, yet again we don't get an 'ex plane' ation. Not one that makes any sense. Turns out Flying Fortresses have a HUGE SECRET to them. Ready??
#Imagine 
you're on a Jumbo Jet airplane and suddenly all the engines stop working, what happens next? Well .... the next thing that happens is that all these bags drop out of the ceiling and you HAVE TO PUT THEM ON, and they make you stoned within seconds so you pass out. Ever wondered why these masks exist? Why is it necessary to sedate airline passengers? 
#Consider: 
In all heavier-than-air jet planes (like Jumbo Jets), if one or multiple jet engines fail, only one jet engine is required stay in the air! There is no explanation yet from Boeing or NASA as to how Jumbo Jets can stay in the air with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating on ONE (not both) wings. Remember the movie Memphis Belle (1990)? Remember at the end of the movie, the B-17 Bomber was flying with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating ONLY ONE WING? Why didn’t the plane immediately drop to one side? What about the real life examples where *ALL* engines  failed and the massive plane was able to turn 180 degrees and return safely to the ground? (Read: Miracle on the Hudson cited at the end of the OP for an example). Have to agree after the last few crashes that something mysterious is failing within these planes, right? I mean, it's not an led light that's the problem here.
#The Big Secret: 
Electromagnetic technology secretly keeps the planes afloat once the (noisy) jet engines are running, while propellers are only used to move the plane forward. EM is 10\^39 more powerful than Gravity, thus anti-gravity technology is trivial and simple to design, and was invented a very long time ago. Starting in WW2, this technology was built into the planes in such a way that their own pilots and engineers did not realize it. This was the only way they could get these TEENAGE PILOTS into the planes and send them hundreds of miles on bombing raids. Allied bombing raids using child pilots is the inspiration behind the book Ender's Game. Older vets would have objected to the global air-force bombings, and they still do today, thus all pilot decision making has been replaced by AUTOMATED DRONE AI. Smaller stunt planes do not need such technology to fly (many still use it, as do all drone bombers), but all Boeing Bombers (i.e. B17, B52) absolutely did since they needed to carry a major payload (unlimited weight) in bombs. These automated over-sized cargo bombers were responsible for over 15 million deaths during the 20th century as they dropped Napalm and other incendiary bombs over 3 thousand human cities towns and villages. Had the allies used normal anti gravity technology to win the war, they would have sent the Memphis Belle boys in flying saucers. The pilots would be well aware of the technology by the end of the war, and we'd all be in our own saucers today. 
#The only reason 
to build an airplane that could never fly by aerodynamic technology alone *IS* to hid the technology from the very pilots who are winning the Allies war. Can you agree that saturated air bombing won WW2? All those houses in that movie The Pianist? 67 Cities in Japan, etc etc. This is how we won WW2. We CHEATED! This is how NAZI Germany, North Korea, Japan (and more recently) Vietnam and Yugoslavia were completely destroyed. This is why you CANNOT get an aviators license without DIRECT APPROVAL by the FAA, which requires a written and oral test proving that you 'understand' (believe in) aerodynamics heavier-than-air flight. This is why the NASA/Boeing boys club has always been so corrupted. This is why NASA is fake, created entirely in-house by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. This is why Jumbo Jets have not improved in design in over 70 *YEARS*. This is why all Jumbo Jets look identical. This is why they NEVER CRASH (with the exception of a major uptick in unexplained crashes since 2014). This is why 9/11 involved (cgi) Jumbo Jets and turned airports into PRISONS. This explains ALL UFO SIGHTINGS. This explains CHEMTRAILS (No human pilots required). Consider that this is the secret NSA (and recently TSA) were created to protect. This is why basically everything you know about the ruinous 20th century, our darkest century. How does one keep such an obvious secret this whole time? Any country that doesn't go along with 'the plan' gets bombs instead of airports.

# By Endless War.
Oh, wait, what's that? Allies were the 'good guys'? Victors of war never tell a lie? Holocaust wasn't a giant hoax? Save it.

A: Because we believe as soon as the world realizes this one thing about airplanes, we can start the healing process from 100 years of endless war. Doesn't that sound good?

Q: No seriously, WHY are you doing this?
A: If you can't tell, there is a serious epidemic of censorship destroying the internet we used to know.

For reference, my professional experience is in engineering design and R&amp;D, with many years in retail/other management as I worked through school.  Long term goals are to move into a Project Engineer or other engineering leadership role.  My current thinking on the various groups hiring are as follows:

Training Systems and Government Services has the fewest employees and that might provide some opportunities to take on different roles simultaneously, adding some diverse experience to my skill set.  However the smaller number of employees might limit advancement opportunities.

BGS was described on this forum as a meritocracy, not reliant on large government contracts like BDS.  Almost as many employees as BDS, so maybe lots of advancement opportunities.  Honestly this group sounds pretty awesome, if I'm as talented as I think I am lol.

BDS looks to be the largest group, so maybe the most roles to advance into.  They also work on some of the worlds coolest stuff, so if I had to be limited in upward mobility there could be worse places to be stuck at.  Also maybe a little more volatile, but most likely not an issue at my location.

Sorry to post a contingency question (I know these are very common and quite redundant), but I had a quick question.

I got the email for that on March 12, and gave my sample for drug screening two days after and finished my HireRight stuff on the 19th. My HireRight report had 1 discrepancy that they didn't notify me about with my University dining service work I did where they only got details of employment til July of 2014, but I claimed Nov 2014 as my end date (because I wasn't aware a second company was paying me for my job at the stadium, even though I get one paycheck).

Other than that everything they were able to validate, I have a clean record and don't do any sort of drugs so I'm not worried about that either.

My question arises in that I was told it takes 2-3 weeks from the day the email was sent on March 12. Now it's April 2 which is exactly 3 weeks.

2) no cross-checking in place to determine wrong sensor input  
3) no limit on the maximum trim  
4) no limit on the number of trim commands issued

&amp;#x200B;

I am  going through the onboarding process right now. I recently completed my drug screening at Quest in the next city over from where I am currently living.  I urinated about 45-50 mins before the test and I may have hydrated too much (1 and a half plastic water bottles) as I am currently fighting a really bad cold ( I do not do drugs btw, I know what this sounds like). The man who administered my drug test said there is a chance that I may have to re-test as my urine was clear and he said it may be too diluted.

Has anyone ever had to re-take? I am currently about to take a long road trip on vacation, and I am freaking out that Boeing will reach out to me while I am traveling this upcoming weekend and not able to find a Quest location open on weekends and that this may put my contingent offer in jeopardy.  I was told by the man at Quest that Boeing would reach out to me the next day if they needed a re-test, and so far they haven't so I guess that's a good sign.

boeing,So I was just hired by the Boeing company a little over two months ago into more of a business role.  As an engineer who has an MBA I was excited to finally start working for Boeing as it was a life long dream.  My plan was to eventually move from more of the business side to the engineering side somewhere down the road.  Here’s my dilemma I want to eventually move over to the engineering side of the business once I was able to get a position that would hire me (yes I’ve applied to engineering positions before).  Now after only being here for two-ish months the location I am at is having a huge hiring event for engineers... I’ve been told their are 400+ positions open.  Only being here for two months I know I shouldn’t go to this event because it would look bad only being at a position at Boeing for 2 months and then trying to switch to engineering.

I haven't reached out to the recruiter or hiring manager yet because it's been less than 2 weeks/10 business days and from what I've read on this sub, it can take a long time to hear back...

The original job posting had a posting date of Feb 2019, but when I logged into Taleo today, the job posting says ""Posting date: March 18, 2019"". This threw me off because it seemed like they re-posted the job? I used a diffchecker and did not see any differences between the original posting, so nothing has changed with the job description.

Is one group getting bad information? Or is it arbitrary where some people get it and some don't? Like I said, all four of us start in the new level the same day, and app four of us have already had the annual raise applied to our pay when we check it in the system.

If we do check tomorrow and half of us got it and half of us didn't is that worth looking into? It seems like a valid complaint, but I'm concerned it will come back to bite me in the ass if we tell HR that were all hanging out talking salary together.",/r/boeing/comments/b121kg/how_do_annual_raises_work_with_promotion/

My understanding is that to over come this autopilot can be switched off and manual control taken until the airspeed read error is resolved. The problem arises  when the pilots were not trained on this scenario and did not take the plane out of autopilot, thus ineffectively fighting against the nose dive until disaster. There can be many reasons for an airspeed sensor not functioning correctly and I think some investigation into why (something happening to sensors on ground or mid-flight; I know insects building nests in sensors have caused this problem in tropical locations before)  and ensuring comprehensive training is carried out by all airlines,  might prove more insightful to investigate this and mitigate in the future.

I know nothing about aviation.  Literally nothing.  Let me state this clearly.

I  have a wild supposition, that had the pilot literally done nothing in these crashes.   Let the computer AI take over, both planes would not have nose dived.

It would be the most difficult decision for a skilled operator to make.   Release control to the computer.

It reminds me of the Titanic in a way...  The best decision the captain could have made after witnessing the iceberg so late, was to slam on the brakes and hit the iceberg head on.

&amp;#x200B;

\#ConsiderThis: In all heavier-than-air jet planes (like Jumbo Jets), if one or multiple jet engines fail, only one jet engine is required stay in the air! There is no explanation yet from Boeing or NASA as to how Jumbo Jets can stay in the air with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating on ONE (not both) wings. Remember the movie Memphis Belle (1990)? Remember at the end of the movie, the B-17 Bomber was flying with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating ONLY ONE WING? Why didn’t the plane immediately drop to one side? The Big Secret: #AntiGravity (or Electromagnetic) technology secretly keeps the planes afloat once the (noisy) jet engines are running, while propellers are only used to move the plane forward. EM is 10\\\^39 more powerful than Gravity, thus anti-gravity technology is trivial and simple to design, and was invented a very long time ago. Starting in WW2, this technology was built into the planes in such a way that their own pilots and engineers did not realize it. This was the only way they could get these TEENAGE PILOTS into the planes and send them hundreds of miles on bombing raids. Older vets would have objected to the global air-force bombings, and they still do today, thus all pilot decision making has been replaced by AUTOMATED DRONE AI. Smaller stunt planes do not need such technology to fly (many still use it, as do all drone bombers), but all Boeing Bombers (i.e. B17, B52) absolutely did since they needed to carry a major payload (unlimited weight) in bombs. These automated over-sized cargo bombers were responsible for over 15 million deaths during the 20th century as they dropped Napalm and other incendiary bombs over 3 thousand human cities towns and villages. This is how we won WW2. This is how North Korea, Japan &amp; Vietnam were completely destroyed. This is why you CANNOT get an aviators license without DIRECT APPROVAL by the FAA, which requires a written and oral test proving that you understand 'aerodynamics'. This is why the NASA/Boeing boys club has always been so corrupted. This is why NASA is fake, created entirely in-house by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. This is why Jumbo Jets have not improved in design in over 70 \\\*YEARS\\\*. This is why all Jumbo Jets look identical. This is why they NEVER CRASH (with the exception of a major uptick in unexplained crashes around 2014) . This is why 9/11 involved (cgi) Jumbo Jets and turned airports into PRISONS. This explains ALL UFO SIGHTINGS. This explains CHEMTRAILS (No human pilots required). Consider that this is the secret NSA (and recently TSA) were created to protect. This is why basically everything you know about the ruinous 20th century, our darkest century. How does one keep such an obvious secret this whole time? Any country that doesn't go along with 'the plan' gets bombs instead of airports.

&amp;#x200B;

Clues for you:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Chronos/Satan/Yahwey/El is really Saturn (the planet), and Earth was one of it's moons (children) during all this cataclysm. Earth was a moon of Saturn (El). Saturn and the Great Planetary Conjunction was the GARDEN OF EDEN. Saturn and Jupiter hid the Sun and bathed baby Earth in buffered soft carbohydrate energy (manna). There were no seasons. Animals did not eat each-other. It was perfect. Suddenly, Earth was cast out into cataclysm and darkness. The rabbis told us it was punishment for sin. Both Jews and Sunni Islam still worship Saturn to this day as the Better Sun and insist no God (like Christ) should be worshiped before Saturn. They are crazy!

&amp;#x200B;

2. Christ is our Sun, not a human! Christ first appeared 2000 years ago rescuing the earth from darkness and terror, and causing all life to 'spring' back into existence. 2000 years ago Humans saw the Sun for the first time. Early Christianity was a Sun worship phenomenon centuries before the Romans turned it into a crucifixion death cult. Christianity was also WORLDWIDE, and existed in native form within EVERY CULTURE ON EARTH.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Religion is Slavery: 6th Century, the Jews were losing their secretive Saturn-worship religion as Saturn was no longer visible or important and everyone was starting to worship the Sun (and has been for 6 centuries already). The Owners of Mecca at the time were Jews, and they owned slaves. Those Slaves left to Medina but every year they would Hajj to Mecca to pay tribute to their Saturnine Symbol of Yahweh/Allah: The Black Cube of Saturn. Thus Jews have been able to control their slaves world-wide through leaking bits of their secretive religion and claiming 'brotherhood' with their own slaves. In modern times, the Jews have completely lost control of Islam, and new domination such as those in Iran and Syria have a version of Islam that COMPLETELY REJECTS SATURN AS GOD. This was the #1 reason for WW1: Jews had to regain control over their old testament slaves, destroying the Ottoman empire that had existed peacefully for 6 centuries. WW2 was therefore a battle between the OTHER wayward slaves of the Jews; the Christians. In WW2, the Jew slave circumcised western Christians slaughtered the Sun worshiping German Christians. That's right. Jews invented Jesus, replacing Sun worship with a dead man on a cross around the same time: 6th century. Judaism and Sunni Islam are Saturnine religions. Most of our planet was Jewish BC. We all did Saturnalia and we still wear Saturn wedding rings. Marriage contracts are only for marrying off slaves!

&amp;#x200B;

4. Electromagnetic/Plasma forces rule the Universe, not Gravity. When planets war with each other, this is actually electromagnetism at work (plasma, really). They can consume one-another (and survive consummation), rip off their surfaces, and destroy each other with lightning. Planets are not Gods, but for all intents and purposes, to tiny humans they are. All humans on earth watched all of this happen. You couldn't avoid it, AND it really mattered in every day life.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Natural earth history is a Vatican lie started well before 1492 when they decided to conquer the world through religion and science. Jesuit Christianity (Focus on the human Jesus) was designed specifically to confuse and infiltrate the natives, and ultimately to enslave them. The earth is not BILLIONS of YEARS old. It's tens of thousands. It doesn't matter. Why? Because the length of a YEAR was not consistent before Year Zero. This is the reason the age ranges of Bible characters are larger the further back you go. Years were shorter and shorter going back to Eden when there were NO SEASONS. 

&amp;#x200B;

6. King David was the Planet Saturn. King Solomon is Sol (The Sun) i.e. Christ. The first Kingdom of Judah was not in the middle east, it was in HEAVEN (The Sky). King David ruled planet earth and would hurl massive mountains and crush the Giants. We know this story as David vs Goliath, but it wasn't the planets that killed the Giants. It was Communism, Commonism, Collectivism, Majorityism, Bolshevism, Elitism i.e. Judaism.

   * I have heard a year from some of my coworkers while some coworkers mentioned that only applies if you received relocation benefits.
* At what point does your current manager get notified that you have applied for another position? (assuming the hiring manager doesn't contact your current manager during the process)
* I'd also like insight from any of you who has dealt with a similar situation as mine and what you did to make things better.

Thanks!

boeing,"So last night I submitted an application for the composite technician position. I am currently working 50 hours a week across two jobs so I was eager to apply for something to get myself out. I tried doing research on the position before applying, but I couldn't find anything online, so I have some questions for composite techs:

1. What do composite technicians for Boeing do? I kind of have a general idea of what I would be doing, but I have found many stories from different people working for different companies. A general rundown of what I will be doing every day will be great!

2. What can I expect for starting pay? Although I have been working a lot recently, the money has been good because I make $15.50/hr at Amazon and $18/hr after tips at my second job. 

3. On the application it said that I have to be able to work weekends and extended hours when necessary. How often does this happen? I wouldn't mind the extra work sometimes, but if I will be frequently working weekends that is a major turnoff for me as I think it is important to have my weekends off. Also, what are the hours usually like? Is this your typical 9-5 job?

Thank you guys for any responses! I do believe that this job will be a huge next step in my life as the work experience would be great and I have been considering getting into engineering, but I just want to know a little more about what I signed myself up for before any potential interviews. :)",/r/boeing/comments/ay4bav/questions_regarding_the_composite_tech_position/

boeing,"Hello Everyone,

The first thing I want to say is a HUGE thank you to everyone of this subreddit. You all have been extremely helpful in helping provide information and allowing me to talk through options and different considerations.

After about 2 years of applying and 3 interviews I finally have an offer on the table. I'm super excited to start the next part of this journey and make the most of it that I can. The offer is working as an Entry Level Software Engineer for international customers in the Training and Professional Services Division at Boeing St. Louis. Looks like I will be working in building 101 at the Berkeley facility. What I'm interested is what did you wish you had known before you have been working at Boeing? 

I've been authorized relocation benefits and will be looking to move to St. Louis after this semester of teaching. What are the best options in terms of living locations? I know I can use the St. Louis subreddit to help locating a good neighborhood to live in, but I'm interested in living in a loft in an area that has some night life to it and lots of things to do. I'm considering CWE, University City, or Maryland Heights but I'm also interested in any opinion because I want to consider everything and make the best decision. If anyone is in the same boat as me and will be hired with a start date June/July and wants to consider rooming up on a 2 br loft or a nice place, let me know.

In terms of working at Boeing, what can I do from the start of working, or even now that I'm doing the next 12 tasks to make the most of it? I read somewhere, I think here or somewhere else, that even how you deal with emails can help a lot in terms of dealing with organization. What can I do in terms of using their educational programs, financial well being programs, or leadership training programs to help facilitate proper growth within the company? 

Again, I want to thank everyone here from the bottom of my soon to be semi-well paid heart for everything that everyone does in this subreddit. I will be sure to answer any questions that people might have in applying, networking, or just general concerns in applying.

*Working in an Agile environment
*Database experience
*Web Services
*Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)
*Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
*Team Foundation Server (TFS)

boeing,"Hey, there!

&amp;#x200B;

**I have a few questions that I'll list bullet-form here at the top so you can just easily and quickly answer them**.

1. How much do Assembler Installer General B's (or similar) net on average per paycheck after overtime and all that? (I know I'll be making $15.75/hour, but I keep being told I'll make much more on average b/c of overtime.)
2. How would someone earn their degree while working 40-50-hours/week at a position like this?
3. How long would it take someone to move from an assembler installer position (or similar) to a business job?
4. How hard is it/is it possible to get rehired after leaving Boeing after only working a couple months?

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's some background for those wondering why I've asked these questions** and also to provide some framework in answering them, to those especially helpful/insightful people:

I'm about to start a new job with Boeing at the Everett Paine Field facility as an ""Assembler Installer General B"" starting tomorrow 02/15/19 at $15.75/hour. I coincidentally just got another job offer from a local ER working as a medic starting at about $30/hour and only working 3 days/week (long days though, mind you). My long-term goal is to change from the medical field ASAP into the business world, and I had *so* many people recommend Boeing to me to be the place to get a paid-for bachelor's in business degree (I already have an associates degree), and then easily transfer to a business-related job (as opposed to being an outsider with zero experience but also having completed a bachelor's degree in business). I've been assured that ""getting \[my\] foot in the door"" with any position I can get is a smart idea for someone with my goals of obtaining a degree and moving into a higher-paying business job, but this other job offer that pays almost twice the hourly rate, and is only a 3-day work week has me reconsidering if \~$15/hour at Boeing is the best move for me, especially considering I'm a husband and father and would like to see my family on occasion. However, if I'll actually be making something like $40k/year as an assembler, and I end up being able to change to a business job in less than a year, then I think it's worth it.

I am a non-union, non-engineering professional in my mid-20s, started a position at BDS late last year at a rather smaller site. 

Prior to my current position at Boeing, I worked for an innovative, fast-paced manufacturing company where I was constantly challenged and was able to keep myself busy in a good way. I had coworkers that I got along great with, and would say I had a pretty good social life at work as well. So far, two things have really stuck out to me in my new position at Boeing.

* Amount of downtime - I typically finish all of my required tasks in less than quarter of the workday, and the remaining amount of time I either act like I'm working, work on personal development stuff (coding/analytics courses etc...), or just plain dicking around
   * I've spoken to my manager a few times about this, and the response he has given me has always been along the lines of ""The xxx program will pick up soon  (undefined period of time) so you'll have plenty to do"", ""Try to learn more about the business/process in your downtime"" etc...
* Can't/don't get along with my coworkers - all of my coworkers are at least 10 years older than I am and have been with the company for 10+ years with a family and we have absolutely nothing but work in common
   * I realize that I'm not coming to work to socialize, but not having anyone to be able to talk about my hobbies or just my daily life makes my day go a lot slower and painful. I also don't have a whole lot of friends in my personal life too so this just makes me feel even shittier

This has been a huge culture shock for me, and I feel like Boeing is not for me and am wasting my time here. But my other dilemma is that I don't want to leave the company with just a few months under my belt and hurt my resume unless I really, really have to. I just wanted to see if anybody could relate with me to any of the things I've come across above in my short time with the company so far, and if so, how did you deal with it?

I want to find out if Boeing would offer any assistance with selling our house as part of their relocation assistance program.  I want to start applying for engineering jobs, but my wife and I own a house in the midwest.  We would need to relocate if I get a job offer, which means finding an apartment wherever the job is.  Problem is, there's no way we could afford an apartment in the Seattle area AND our mortgage at the same time, and I'd hate to be stuck in a situation where I accept a job offer, relocate, and then the house doesn't sell.  Lots of jobs say they offer ""relocation assistance,"" but I can't find anywhere on the website that gives details on what all that assistance can include.  So at the moment I'm hesitating on applying for any jobs.

Does anyone know if Boeing might offer any assistance with selling our home?  Or, does anyone know who I can contact at Boeing to get more information about their relocation assistance?

Thank you!",/r/boeing/comments/akp6vl/relocation_assistance/
boeing,"My question is in regards to getting reassigned to a different program...I went through orientation on Friday, was very excited to be there. Was chatting with everyone about the planes and how stoked I was to be working on the new 777X. I had heard from an employee that I have connections with that they were hiring like mad for the new program. Fast forward to the part of the day where we see our training schedule...and I'm one of two people assigned to the 747/767 program. My heart sank, I am very good at finding creative solutions to problems and was hoping to being able to shine on a new plane. My end goal is to get my ME degree and take on a liaison role within Boeing. I felt that showing my skills to my manager would help get me on a fast track to that career. No I feel like I'm on a plane that is only really getting freighter orders and has been swallowed up by the 787 future planes. 

Should I express myself to my manager? Should I show my hand of cards so to speak, or does the tallest flower end up getting cut? I don't want to ruffle any feathers as a first impression, nor do I want to come into an established program and butt heads with anyone. Should I just trust that my creativity will show and that it will all work out? Or should I qualm my thoughts of being on a dying plane and just get to work?",/r/boeing/comments/akl9ho/got_assigned_to_everett_production_and_now_im/

I just received an entry level software engineer offer at Boeing in Everett, Washington.

How is negotiation? I was hoping to get a 10-20% increase (reasons being: I am overqualified for entry level since I have been working in the field for two years while completing my degree in CS, graduated with a high GPA, washington is extremely far from home and from my research it is not as desirable as other states I have offers from, etc).

My other offers are not higher than the current offer from Boeing but that is because the cost of living is much cheaper in the cities I got offers from (all of which are fortune 500).

Were you able to negotiate an increase this large?

I have a few questions for those of you who have gone and are currently going through the Boeing hiring process. I am a senior graduating in June 2019. I've been actively applying to Boeing in Washington since September for entry level methods process analyst, manufacturing engineer, and industrial engineer positions. So far none of my 15+ submissions have successfully turned into interviews but none of them have been changed to ""no longer under consideration."" I did however apply to a job that I was definitely under qualified for to test the ATS  and did get an update for ""no longer under consideration"". If it adds any value, all of the positions still have their withdraw button present. 

I'm starting to get a little anxious and worried. I've been trying to keep my hopes up as I applied to Northrop Grumman last year during September and was finally called, interviewed, and given an offer in January. I'm hoping that Boeing is somewhat similar in this regard.

Is it normal for these applications to take upwards of 3 months to turn into interviews? If anybody has information that can help me better identify the position that I'm in, it would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

boeing,"Throwaway, because obviously.

I have a quasi-co-worker (he’s in the same dept, but currently on a different shift) - lets call him “Blingy” - who many of my teammates would like to see fired.

Petty, you say?

Perhaps a little - he’s not well liked for his arrogant &amp; entitled attitude, but it’s mainly his getting away with some big no no’s. Such as:

- regularly smoking pot. Blingy has outright refused to do certain tasks because they could potentially result in damage to production parts, which would require a drug test... which he has said he would fail because of his pot usage. However, apparently because two managers need to hear this, it’s somehow not actionable(?!?!) He’s been witnessed consuming in the parking lot as well. I’ve been close enough to smell it on him a few times.

- regularly avoiding work for *hours at a time.* He's been CAM’d for this, but still does it. He’s infamous for doing it, in fact. It’s been said he’s lazy, but I disagree: Blingy puts significant effort into *NOT* working.

- the latest thing: not knowing how to use specialized tools that he’s assigned to. He’s supposed to be in charge of a particular machine, and has been very territorial about other people using it. But since he’s on another shift, myself &amp; some others went to do some work on this machine &amp; discovered it was not calibrated properly (it was off by *hundredths* of an inch; tolerance is *hundred thousandths*) It’s been well known for a while that work produced by Blingy is substandard, and at least one engineer refuses to assign work to him at all because of this. Blingy was either unaware, and/or didn’t care that his machine was grossly out of tolerance. 

- oh, and as soon as he realized other people were “messing” with “his” machine, he locked up what accessories he could and tried to make the machine unusable. He failed because several of us on our shift know quite a bit more about it than he does.

There’s plenty more, much of it documented. This is a shaving off the tip of the iceberg.

I’m proud of this company &amp; what we do, and it bothers me that someone with such a terrible work ethic hasn’t been punished.

Anyway, advice on how to bring any relevant info to HR would be helpful.

I just wanted to get general opinions about this opportunity from fellow Boeing employees, preferably some firsthand experience in the Puget Sound region.

I just received the offer yesterday (along with one from a different company, it was a wild couple of hours) for a level 2 design position. Currently I am working in stress down in Mesa, AZ.

Responses like: ""it's gonna take you like 25 minutes to walk through the parking lot there!"" and ""you'll never see the sun and the traffic is terrible, no one is friendly or goes outside!""

For me, the pay is a definite upgrade from where I'm at now (especially with relo), and the job opportunity sounds great.

I looked through the report and there isn’t anything marked or highlighted that points out what they might be hinting at. There are two things that I believe they might be concerned with which I’ll list below, but it isn’t called out in the report. 

1. I was terminated from a job over a year and a half ago that I held for just a few months. The report says pending and appears that they hadn’t gotten ahold of anyone there since it’s left blank. Knowing the company I question, I’m sure they’re ignoring the calls from HireRight. 

2. My credit is subpar. I don’t have a bankruptcy or a repossession, but due to being out of work for several months a couple years ago due to spinal surgery, I’ve been in credit repair mode ever since.

As you can imagine the road hasn’t been easy and I’ve suffered some humility by it all. However, I used the experience as a motivational factor to get my life in order. Unfortunately, i wasn’t about to get back to school as his medical bills, in addition to my mortgage, didn’t allow me the opportunity of time and funding. Now, after gaining the experience to warrant joining the company that I’ve been seeking after for 10 years, I find that the company’s management is cruel and dispassionate. Despite having the working knowledge to hold positions above my station, I am being passed over for a person holding a degree and has no experience. 

The message conveyed is that I’m worthless.  Yet I’m asked to train those above me.  How is my experience not worth consideration? Why is there a higher reverence for a college degree than working knowledge and understanding of process and procedures?

I am perplexed by the “BeBoeing attitude” vs actual treatment of personnel. I’m not inspired by a leadership that is unable to utilize the skill sets of their employees for favor of an afforded education.  I respect the degrees earned by my fellow coworkers; I just want an equal amount of respect by my management for the experience I bring to the table.

Does anyone have experience with this division? Is it a good place to work as a mechanical design engineer? It sounds like I would be designing test equipment, but I can’t really tell how involved the design work is or how much paperwork/managment would be involved.

Background: I'm moving from Atlanta to work at the Everett site (the 40-88 building specifically) sometime next January, and I'll have just graduated with my AE degree as well. With the exception of two friends in my class who also got the same offer, I don't know anyone who lives in the Seattle area, nor have I ever visited the city. I've heard amazing things about the Seattle area though and as a cycling enthusiast I'm really hyped about making the move.  
I'm trying to figure out what part of town to live in initially as I arrive. The difficult part seems to be balancing the commute time versus the benefits of living closer to Seattle. On the one hand, it would be amazing if I had the ability to bike to work every morning and lived close enough to do so (there are ways to do that, right?), but on the other hand I don't want to live far away from Seattle and miss out on the social opportunities. Plus I've heard that there are certain areas of Everett you should avoid. Moving closer to Seattle means rent goes up and so does the commute time, but I just wanted to see and get some advice on if the benefits of living closer outweighed those costs, especially as a single guy who will have (next to) no friends.

I was curious if any of you could offer insight into my current application status situation. I applied for a finance internship at the El Segundo facility on August 29th, and on the same day my application was changed from ""Under Review"" to ""Under Consideration"". I'ts been more than three weeks and my status has not changed, nor have I received any email about coming in for an interview. Is it fair to say they have moved on or found a more eligible applicant and they are just finalizing everything?

Also, the job posting is still showing on their website.

boeing,"I’m new to the company, so if this is frowned upon in any way, I’ll gladly remove this thread. 

I just want to honestly offer a few options to those that are relocating to the OKC area, or are interning at this site. 

We recently had a late summer intern that used Craigslist to find housing, which he paid $500 a month for a bedroom, living in someone’s home. Apparently, this wasn’t a pleasant experience for the intern as it was all “site unseen” and the “landlord” was very rude the whole stay. We also just had a few new hires from out of state and one in particular told me his/her housing situation and they’re paying about $200 more than market value for a one bed/one bath apartment for the next year. That’s ridiculous. A company took someone with no knowledge of the area and is essentially over charging them for a place to live. I’ll add that this new hire is fresh out of college and will be struggling to make ends meet because of what they’re paying in rent. 

Shamelessly adding now; my wife is a property manager for a company that owns/operates multiple complexes/townhomes throughout the OKC metro area. You’d have your choice to live as far north as Edmond, or as far south as Norman. The site is located near Tinker AFB in Midwest City. You can PM me if you’d like and I’d gladly give you contact information to the management company so you can view where you’re moving to and negotiate pricing. 

*That’s the one thing I’d like for you to take away from this, don’t be afraid to negotiate your deposit/security/rent. People don’t seem to know that that’s something that one can do. Ask about discounts and ask about monthly specials, every property has them, and every property uses them to ensure someone will lease with them.*

Anyways, I hope this helps someone in the future, even if you don’t contact me just know that you can negotiate these things. They need your money just as much as you need a place to stay.

Looking at my completed background report, it says Discrepancy next to that employment check, but it doesn't tell me what the discrepancy is.

Under ""Information Verified"" it says that HireRight verified the internship dates (to the day, whereas I only put in the months and year), verified a different intern title (e.g. I put in ""Manufacturing Intern"", but they verified ""Intern II""), and the company name that they verified doesn't contain ""Inc."" at the end, which I said it did.

But here's the kicker. For a previous internship, I said I worked it during the summer of 2016 (which is true), but under ""Information Verified"" it says my dates of employment were July-Dec of 2016. Yet there is no discrepancy.

I was recently contacted by Boeing (specifically Boeing Intelligence &amp; Analytics), and they are interested in my application and would like to interview. However, prior to them proceeding with the  interview process, they require that I sign/return a legal document that throws up numerous red flags for me. Specifically the 2nd paragraph and the 6th paragraph. Additionally, it was provided to me via a simple Word document, without any company logos or special formatting. My interpretation is that, by signing this, I am immediately giving up all job security or benefit security with Boeing. I've pasted the entire document below. Has anybody else had to deal with this when interviewing with Boeing? Any thoughts/opinions are welcome, thanks.  




In exchange for the consideration of my job application by Boeing Intelligence &amp; Analytics (herein after call   ""the Company""), I agree that:

Neither the acceptance of this application   nor the subsequent entry into any type of employment relationship, either in   the position applied for or any other position, and regardless of the   contents of employee handbooks, personnel manuals, benefit plans, policy   statements, and the like as they may exist from time to time, or other   Company practices, shall serve to create an actual or implied contract of   employment, or to confer any right to remain an employee of Boeing Intelligence &amp; Analytics, or otherwise to change in any respect the   employment-at-will relationship between it and the undersigned, and that   relationship cannot be altered except by a written instrument signed by the   President/General Manager of the Company.  Both the undersigned and   Boeing Intelligence &amp;   Analytics may end the   employment relationship at any time, without specified notice or   reason.  If employed, I understand that the Company may unilaterally   change or revise their benefits, policies and procedures and such changes may   include reduction in benefits.

I authorize investigation of all statements   contained in this application.  I hereby represent that the   information I have provided above is true and accurate.  I understand   that the misrepresentation or omission of facts is cause for dismissal at any   time without any previous notice.  I hereby give the Company permission   to contact schools, previous employers (unless otherwise indicated),   references, and others, and hereby release the Company from any liability as   a result of such contract.

I also understand that (1) the Company may   institute a drug and alcohol policy that provides for pre-employment testing   as well as testing after employment, (2) consent to and compliance with such   a policy is a condition of my employment; and (3) continued employment is   based on the successful passing of testing under such policy.  I further   understand that continued employment may be based on successful passing of   job-related physical examinations (if applicable). 

I understand that, in connection with the   routine processing of your employment application, the Company may request   from a consumer reporting agency an investigative consumer report including   information as to my credit records, character, general reputation, personal   characteristics, and mode of living.  Upon written request from me, the   Company, will provide me with additional information concerning the nature   and scope of any such report requested by it, as required by the Fair Credit   Reporting Act.

I further understand that my employment with the Company shall be probationary for a period of sixty (60) days, and   further that at any time during the probationary period or thereafter, my employment relation with the Company is terminable at will for any reason by either party.

I'll be relocating to Washington. Has anyone used their relocation service?

Basically, how does the process get started for them to help me move? Do I reach out to them, or is someone supposed to contact me and explain all of this???

Also, if you have used them, do they have rent discounts or anything like that, or is what I see online what I can expect for cost?

I'm a recent grad who got a offer from Boeing BDS. My background check is taking quite a while, and I was wondering if this is unusual. Here's the timeline so far:

June 19th - Received offer
June 23th - Accepted offer
June 26th - Completed Task List
June 28th - Completed drug testing, started background
July 5th - Recieved 'Verified' HireRight Background Report

And that's it. My background report (via HireRight) still says ""Pending"" for both the HireRight and Boeing checks. There were two 'discrepancies' in my employment history (both at recent jobs with my university), but other than that, no real issues.

I've had almost a month without any updatesv which seems like a while compared to some of the threads I've seen here. Should I be worried? Is there someone I can call to make sure I haven't been 'lost in the shuffle'?

I've left my student job, because I'm not a student, and I'm wondering if I should pick up a job in the meantime. If this takes another month, I'll be in real trouble. 

Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

Anyone have success trying something like this?

Is this the kind of thing you just bring up during open enrollment? Or do you make an appointment with someone in HR? Or shoot an email? I'm pretty new to the company still and haven't really had many interactions with the HR side of the house.

I got an offer from Boeing this past April and, since they only gave me a week, chose to sign it then thinking it was the best opportunity I was probably going to receive for the next year. I even negotiated a signing bonus, one of the reasons I gave HR was that there was a lot of opportunity cost involved with signing almost a year out from actually starting. Important to note though that I haven't received any money from them and won't until like 2 weeks after my first day.

I’m interested in a reverse commute from North Seattle to the Boeing facility (around a 30min commute). I have a couple questions that relate to the neighborhoods of the City/transplants from the South.

——————————

**What I’m looking for in a neighborhood/district:**
- easy access to the I-5 to make the commute easier
- an area with a good number of 20-somethings/millennials (I’ll hesitate using that term)
- be in the Seattle city limits, preferably on the Northern side of town
- Rent around $1,200-$1,800


**Neighborhoods I’m interested in (feel free to give your thoughts)**
- Green Lake
- University District
- Ravenna
- Northgate
- Maple Leaf

boeing,"When most people hear the term welding, they think of metals being fused together, creating sparks similar to those produced by a 4th of July sparkler. This “messy” process of welding produces slag (i.e., byproducts that chips off the weld). It’s known as “Arc Welding” or “Shielded Metal Arc Welding” (SMAW) and is a very popular form of welding.

### However, there is also a “clean” process of welding known as:

  - “Gas Tungsten Arc Welding” (GTAW)
  - “Gas Tungsten Arc” (GTA)
  - “Tungsten Inert Gas” (TIG) Welding
  - “heliarc welding”
  - “fusion welding”

The terms above all refer to the same thing – a clean process of welding producing no slag. This type of welding is useful for critical applications, or when it’s necessary to produce a beautiful surface finish.

boeing,"Using a throwaway for OPSEC reasons.

Hello, everyone. I wanted to know everybody's experience in dealing with interns who submitted for intern to intern conversion for the following summer, and possible advice on my next course of action.

Quick backstory, I accepted and completed a summer internship last year with the Boeing Company as an engineer intern. The thing with our entire team was that due to a ""certain regional activity"" (don't want to say any more) taking place at the time, all interns in my business unit were told, prior to the start of the internship, we would most likely not be invited back or offered FT positions with that business unit, and encouraged to start networking with the other business partners within Boeing (BCA, BDS, BGS etc)

I was given a positive review at the end, and was even given several weeks of extension after finishing my initial 3 months with offer of recommendation letter from several managers and the director. So I don't think I did too bad, as this was my first internship.

So my problem is, I submitted my application for the intern to intern conversion but have not received any word yet. I reached out to a two managers in a different business unit that I networked with during last summer but they don't seem all too reliable; offered to help but goes silent when I send a followup mail. The last I heard from one of the manager is a forwarded e-mail where he asked an HR rep on opening a req for an intern position (this was over a month ago with no response), and the other manager telling me they are opening req for interns soon and will ""keep me posted"". So far, most managers are probably busy and typically do not keep me posted until I send a followup e-mail usually in 1-2 week interval.

What is the typical rate that interns are reinvited back for another internship? Do hiring team review applications from the intern conversion before checking through career fair/individual submissions? I really loved the culture and work at Boeing and want to make a career out of this. Was even planning on applying for ECFP this summer as I did not meet the requirement last year.",/r/boeing/comments/80scvz/intern_to_intern_conversion/

boeing,"As a person who has been working in Boeing for 5 years and counting, I have a question about promotion.

I noticed that recently, the odd of promotion is becoming more difficult. The reason for this is Boeing wants engineers to rotate around various roles and be average at all of those.

In other words, when there is a new airplane program, the job positions open but filled by people with somewhat different expertise. For example, people who have been working on fuselage structure, who has enough experience to maybe get promoted, had to transfer to systems structure. The cause might be the current program he/she was in was downsizing and had to offload head count to that different org.

If this happens, suddenly, a person with almost enough experience to be promoted, is effectively now a person who know nothing about systems structure.

It is fair to say that, there are common skill-set for both programs. Thus, the person can still perform what is required as an structure engineer. However, that person is now not as confident and no more a subject matter expert anymore. That person has to rely on leads for help and have to reclaim that experience to be considered for promotion.

After a while, now that person needs to move again to different position, perhaps like Liasion Engineer, because the program has finished and have to offload people.

I see this commonly and have personally experienced it. I have worked in a fatigue/damage tolerance group and then transferred to fuselage production support to now, systems stress. Yes, I now have varied experience but have no real depth.

I see that there are few coworkers who share the same sentiment. I know a person who has 15 years of experience and have just been floating around the company doing level 2/3 work the whole time. If he was able to stick to one group, he might have become level 4 by now.

I'm applying for a fabrication production engineering internship at Boeing in Auburn, Washington.  Here's the link to the job posting:

https://jobs.boeing.com/job/auburn/fabrication-productionengineering-internship-paid-summer-2018/185/6527079

Does anyone have any experience with or has advice for a student applying to this job, such as software proficiency or other skills?  I'm trying to gear my resume towards this one so that I can improve my chances, so if there's anything that should be emphasized on my resume, I would greatly appreciate it.

I have a friend who also just got hired and finished his week long on-boarding right before the week of Thanksgiving.

This summer I will be in the Boeing Business Intern Program. I'm trying to rent a car through Avis but the location I need to rent from will not accept debit cards if you are under 25. I will be traveling across the country so I cannot use my parents cards and am trying to not put 6000+ miles on my run down Suzuki. I recently applied for a Chase Freedom Unlimited card but am still waiting to see if I will be accepted. I also will need my credit limit to be at least 2,000 in order for it to cover the rental cost. Does anyone know if Boeing can help me in any way?

I have an interesting, but good problem on hand. Out of nowhere I have been offered three different internships in three different groups. While I could see myself in all three, I would like to treat it as if there was a good chance to go full time afterwords. I interned once at Boeing before, but all of the new offers are in a new location. I am truly grateful to have so many possibilities, but I cannot seem to pick one over the others. Perhaps location can help tilt the scales.

What are the pros and cons of each of these cities: Seal Beach CA, Everett WA, and Renton WA?

All three are about the same distance from home, similar interest level, and costs should be relatively equal. Thank you for your assistance! :)",/r/boeing/comments/5zdhyz/multiple_offers_help_me_pick_a_location/

The job is quite far, so I want to know what I'm getting into.

I'm hoping someone from inside Boeing might be able to answer this. I am looking at internships for Aerospace Engineering, and Boeing has always been a great interest of mine. I keep hearing about layoffs in the company, especially in commercial aircraft which is what I was most interested in. Should I avoid Boeing because I could get a job and then be part of a budget cut? (Of course, if I don't do good work then I shouldn't expect to stay). But I don't want to start somewhere just to be laid off a few years later. I am currently looking at a structures engineering position, but am interested in many areas, especially those with greater job security.

1. I'm a Junior. How often do interns get to come back the following year for a 2nd internship?

2. How often do interns secure full time positions? Does the internship REALLY REALLY improve your chances or is it just another resume bullet?

3. Do most interns that DO get hired full time work in the field they interned in or do they just apply to many jobs and hope the internship gets their foot in the door?

I really really want to work at Boeing when I graduate for decades to come, so I'm just trying to gauge if I can already expect to based on securing an internship or if I still have a ways to go to that dream.

For what it's worth, I'm a veteran with a security clearance and have worked as a web developer, so I do feel I have a few other things going for me at least on my resume.",/r/boeing/comments/5owalz/how_often_does_internship_full_time_happen_2nd/

I'm a recent college graduate looking into engineering jobs at Boeing. I have a B.S. in mechanic engineering.

I've heard that it is very common, and relatively easy, to move around within the Boeing Company. For example you might start as a stress engineer and switch to aerodynamics.

How long do you have to work at the company before requesting to be repositioned? And do current employees have a large advantage over a non-employee when competing for a position? Thanks for the help!",/r/boeing/comments/567w13/changing_groups_internally/

Boeing is at the top of my list of companies that I'm interested in, and I've applied to multiple positions.  I haven't had any luck with online applications, but a recruiter that I spoke to at an on-campus event was very impressed with my resume.

Still, I think they ran out of interview timeslots, and I didn't get one.  It has been a discouraging process, but I am still very interested and trying to be gracious in the face of adversity.  What feels the worst is that I didn't end up getting the recruiter's contact information, which I almost always make a point to do.

I've read some not so great things about Boeing IT here and there around the internet such as the tech is old, or the work force is old, or too much politics, etc. However I've also heard that its a well regarded company that provides excellent benefits. If you work for Boeing's IT division, do enjoy working there and would you recommend a young person (23 yrs old) working there? Are there frequent opportunities for upward movement/promotions? I know Boeing as a company that is very reputable but is it's IT division as well regarded? Is the work challenging? fun? engaging? And what are the people really like working there?

Just a warning- I don't know how jobs work at Boeing, so please forgive me for not use abbreviations or anything.

So I'm a High School freshman in the Puget Sound area (Seattle) and am looking to possibly get a job at Boeing in the future (after college). I would want to get a job as an engineer (probably structural) so that I could actually take part indesigning the wings, fuselage, etc. of the plane. I know that I would have to probably get promoted to that position, and that it's probably very much wanted, but how would you suggest I shape my HS and college career to eventually meet that goal? Also, I might want to work at Microsoft or another big tech company so it'd be great to get a college degree in something that would work for Boeing and tech companies.

I know I would have to probably have previous experience to get hired at Boeing, so what kind of job would help me there? Thx for helping!",/r/boeing/comments/4sdxep/advice_for_my_future_career/

boeing,"Hello I’m currently looking into 2 position that Boeing has available but I have some questions about both. Both are entry level positions and are in the subdivision Strategic Missile Defense Systems of the Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS) division. One of them would be as a systems engineering analyst in Huntsville working on GMD project. The other position would be as an electrical engineer for the ICBM Minuteman 3 subsystem in Utah Hill AFB.

So my question pertains to what would be a typical day be like working as an EE on that project and or a systems engineer analyst as the other? Anyone that has experience with either or with those locations please let me know what you thought of the atmosphere, culture, etc? Also if I take the systems engineering analyst position would it hinder me in getting back to an EE position in the future?

Something I’m nervous about is that my degree is in EE and I’m nervous about seeing if I’m capable of doing the systems engineering since it wouldn’t be exactly EE related. The only thing that really has me hesitant about the Sys. Engineering Analyst position is if there’s a lot of coding involved. I think there wouldn’t be much/ a lot because they would have needed a software engineer instead. Anyone have any advice about this or experience with doing the changeover from what you studied?

Thank you in advance!

boeing,"Hello. Any EE working at Boeing could share what your typical day is like? Do you feel like there are something to learn everyday?

I got an entry level EE job offer which was quite exciting to me as Boeing has been my dream company for a long time. But from the interview, I have an impression that there isn't going to be much to learn. It sounded like Boeing as an organization pretty much outsource all the electrical/electronics design works to subcontractors with no in-house design capability. After doing some further researches, my impression seems to be true. For example, Boeing did not have the knowledge to fix the 787 battery fire problem as the entire electrical system design was outsourced to a French company. Boeing's solution was to put the battery inside a thick case strong enough to withstand the explosion and eject the hot gas outside. None of the avionic systems on the jet was developed by Boeing, as what used to be the Boeing Commercial Electronics was sold to BAE Systems... In short, should I look elsewhere?

Hello, how are you? I would like to know your advice on something which I cannot decide no matter how hard I think about it. Im 19 years old and Im in my first university year in Physics. I live in Argentina, where there is no division between college and school. You choose a career and you get the m.s after 6 years in the same place you started. I still cant decide even if Im on my first year as they are almost the same classes between the two the first years. I want to choose something that might have an impact on the world. Help the world become better and more advanced.


I like Physics because I am the kind of person which questions everything, not only about Physics but about everything about life. If it were for me I would study physics, engineering, biology and computer science. Also, I would like to, in the future, being useful to humanities technological and scientifical development. And physics seems like a good choice as it basically covers every aspect of the Universe. But, I am also really concerned on the practical aspect of it. I want to help our world become a better place. Help Develop to become a better civilization. Physics might not be the best choice as it is soo abstract I don't think its applications, modern physics, would help much. I was planning on maybe do applied physics as a Phd or engineering as a second career (Really choosing a life path so early is hard!)


Engineering was always my second choice, but right now I am leaning towards it. As I find It will give me better tools and more freedom to accomplish my goals. Also it would be less theorethical with more applications. I was thinking Mechanical Engineering maybe. working in Aerospace is one of my dreams. What would an engineering degree allow me to do there? And what would a Physics degree differentiate in?

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Is there a right way to ask HR about possible assistance in the form of a signing bonus?

After some digging around, it seems Boeing has a shorter interview process than other engineering companies, even to the point where people get an offer after a single phone interview.

I am wondering if anyone who has been on either side of the interview process has any insights as to how long I should expect this process to take and if it is possible to get a job offer after only phone interview/s.

boeing,"Hi!

I've just come off a Qatar Airways flight in a 787. Wonderful beast. I was mesmerised by the wing the whole flight, and stunned by the carbon fibre thrust reversers. If you get a chance to fly slightly in front of the wing, take a look down at the reactor on landing, because that carbon fibre lattice is absolutely amazing! (Didn't get a chance to picture it and couldn't find a picture online :( )

Now, having stared at the wing for the better part of the flight, I eventually noticed [something dodgy](http://i.imgur.com/P04utJr.jpg) on the reactor. Notice above the fin, there is a bit of lining sticking up. This flattened out on slowing down, and flattened back out completely once landed. But I'm pretty sure this isn't by aerodynamic design, nor by negligence from QR. This is obviously not a structural piece, but I am no Aero Engineer, simply a CS student :3

Apologies if this isn't the right place, I don't think Boeing have planned a real ""Please notify us if the plane starts falling apart"" page on their website, and I can't find aviation enthusiast subreddits... I am hoping some guy can explain what the piece is and what it is actually for, and maybe some Boeing engineer to see it as well.",/r/boeing/comments/3d04wm/reactor_issue/

I love working hard and playing hard. I networked to a finance internship with my university as a sophomore, I then had an internship with a top (if not the biggest) Private Wealth Management firm. Currently I am interning 40 hours a week (unpaid) with a boutique investment bank while doing a full course load at school as well as being involved on campus. This summer, I will be interning with Boeing as an ""estimating and pricing"" intern analyst; I do not know yet if it will be with BDS or BCA.

Since I am a junior, I will most likely get a return offer after this summer. I am interested in working for Boeing for various reasons, but I do not know what the career progression is. My other option is to use my Investment Banking internship and Boeing to interview with Investment Banks (bulge brackets and middle markets) this coming Fall quarter.

Now...I am trying to determine what the career progression at Boeing is like. From what I gathered talking to the Boeing employees, everyone works 40 hours a week and that's that; maybe some overtime, but not past 50. I am a type A personality; while I am young, I want to work as much hours as possible, learn as much, climb up the ladder as high as possible. Is Boeing a place for me to do this? I would like to work for Boeing for multiple reasons: cost of living in Seattle/OKC/St.Louis is cheaper than NYC/SF/Chicago, they pay for your MBA/JD. But on the otherside, I don't want to simply work 40 hours a week. What is the career progression and pay progression like?",/r/boeing/comments/2wxgyq/business_career_progression_at_boeing/

boeing,"Hi guys hopefully someone here may know what I should do....

I was at a big Boeing hiring event this week myself and 200+ offers were given out offers all at once. So I was able to hear many of the salaries that were being given to students who attended. 

Everyone there was an engineer and from a top 20ish school.  (I was #10ish school). 

Salaries for **undergraduates were ranging from 70K-76K** depending on location.

I am a **Master's Student** (Electrical and computer engineering) with **3 years** of work experience at a large semiconductor company. And got a **79.5K offer**.... (For the very expensive to live in **South California sites**)

I think they may have missed my work experience when building my offer but a **3K** bump for being a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering is pretty crappy. And almost insulting really...

I was seriously considering Boeing for their cool work and even willing to take a pay cut to join them. But I can get 85K in my current city any day of the week... And easily get 95K with a couple extra interviews. (My city also has a 30% cost of living less than the Huntington beach site)

At this point I am not sure what I should do with Boeing. 

**Is this offer consistent with things you have seen in the past?**

**If not how much have you folks seen Master's come in with?**

**Should I press them to revaluate the offer?**

**Should I let them know that this offer is very low for the orange county area?**

**Should I tell them that this offer is very similar to Undergraduate offers that they are giving out?**

**Would It be better for me to express my concerns to HR or the hiring manager?**

I am not sure how they expect me to be a **loyal** employee with a salary like this once I have any amount of training I will be leaving to another posting that is ~100K from one of the many Californian companies...

I'm new to this subreddit. Am loving it so far! I was hoping you might be able to help me answer a couple questions I've always wondered about:

* What's next after the 787? The 797?
* What do you think will happen when Boeing runs out of 7x7 nomenclature? I know they once developed a supersonic airplane and called it the 2707, so I could see them pursuing something like that.
* I know different Boeing jets have different purposes (e.g. the 737 is for short flights, the 747 is used for long flights) and some of the jets no longer are sold (e.g. 707, 727). But what are the differences between the 747, 757, 767, 777, and now 787 (in terms of what they're used for)?
* I saw a documentary on the Discovery Channel recently about the 747, and it said the 747-8 could go within like 12mph of the speed of sound (Wikipedia says max suggested operating speed is Mach 0.90). Is it possible/feasible that some future variant of the 747 (or another Boeing passenger jet) could exceed the speed of sound routinely? Aircraft technology has come a long way since the Concorde/2707/Tu-144 were designed, so I could potentially see it being possible (although as to whether it would be practical is another matter).

Thanks, guys!

There are different ways we can all contribute!

* Please post as often as you can! Don't worry about over-posting, we need content right now. 

* Please comment and engage in discussions! 

* Please subscribe! This way, you can see posts even if they only have a couple of up-votes (due to a lack of traffic). Don't worry, your ""front-page"" won't get clogged with stuff from here; reddit's code prvents that. 

* We need a designer that can contribute awesome header images, and anything else that can contribute to /r/boeing's quality! 

* If you have anymore suggestions, please let a moderator know. 

**Keep in mind, there's only one moderator right now (me), which means when we need moderator additions (soon), I will select those who engage the most.**

boeing,"Hey all,

I was recently hired for a software engineering position and have my orientation scheduled for July 31st (at the St. Louis location) and I have a few questions that hopefully you can answer to ease my new grad nerves.

1. What is orientation going to look like now with covid? Generally, how will that first day play out?
2. In a sentence or two what would you say my first 1-2 weeks at Boeing will consist of/what will I be doing? Jump right into work or hours of informational videos like others have mentioned?
3. In general, is the St. Louis location still operating totally normal with covid and all? Or are a lot of people working from home?

I was an IE a few years ago and when I brought feedback from the shop I would be shut down and management would say something like ""you have a degree you need to direct the shop what to do.""

Sorry my degree taught me stats and data analysis not the right way to upsize holes or the best ways to prep a surface for paint so I'm going to defer to the guy doing the job for 15-30 years and listen to their experience and most importantly complaints. If I can get them a new drill jig to run two drills at a time or some kind of engineering-controlled job aid for torque values then hell yeah I'll go do that and make sure it's always up to date. 

I didn't last long for this and other reasons.

It stinks because I worked at other smaller aerospace firms and they did the NASA 'yellow board' thing where anyone on the floor could submit ideas for changes on a paper easel and us office types would try and run down a good solution.  Of course not all ideas were implemented but I felt a lot more connected and hell I learned things. It didn't feel like there was this great divide between the desk jobs and the floor jobs. Speaking for just my short time back at BCA it felt like an 'us vs them' relationship. I really honestly just wanted to make the work more bearable for those doing it and if there was a cost savings fine, I figured if I made the job less of a pain in the ass and folks didn't ask for transfers or rotate or quit on their own they'd get better at it and you'd naturally get shorter bars, but the focus was on shortening bars and hoping everything else just happens too.

I do hold out hope that the crisis brings people back to talking and not just furthers the divide.

Even the 737NG was a stretch, as the classic-line already was in trouble with the low wings. The MCAS fiasco is direct result of the outdated design of 737 drowning in itself on ventilator.

737 should have been abandoned right after NG or even at the classics, as it was obvious the design cannot be competitive in the future.

That being said, the 717 wasn't really any better in this regard, as being a tail-engine design, it neither likely cannot handle the larger engines because of CG and tail being low on rotate.",/r/boeing/comments/hrzk1a/why_didnt_boeing_discontinue_the_737_after_the/fyncq0a/

boeing,"""under consideration"" means you haven't been eliminated.

After a req closes they screen out people who don't meet basic requirements. (Don't have degree, said you only have 2 years of experience for a senior positon, etc)

A manager will go through and look at resumes to pick people for interviews. Some managers will also use this time to mark off candidates they aren't interested in, but some don't.

Once they have picked interview candidates, tehy will schedule interviews and conduct them. If they pick a candidate, they will prepare an offer. Up until the selected candidate chooses to accept the offer, every candidate who hasn't been eliminated is ""under consideration."" There's no way to tell how many people are in pool with you

There is always the chance the selected candidate doesn't take offer or they decide to interview more people, so it can take awhile.

Sometimes the req is for multiple positions (a ""hub req"") in which case multiple managers are picking and choosing out of the pool. Sometimes a manager finds your resume and thinks you're a better fit for one of teh other managers hiring and will forward your note, so sometimes you get interviewed twice or hired by a manager who didn't actually interview you. Usually the req is clear its for several positions when its a hub req.

Each time you get an updated that means you moved on to the smaller pool, generally speaking, and for that particular posting. No update, means you are still in thr main pool with everyone else who applied.

To the point on how big the pool is. For the first part I would say maybe 500 minimum for most postings right now. More popular categories, are easily in the 1,000+.

If you search deep within the archives of [airliners.net](https://airliners.net), you may find the plans and tooling for the 757 buried somewhere in there...

There have been some trade studies and chatter about a 767-MAX type aircraft, and when you look at it, it does make some sense on the surface. 7-wide seating with twin aisle, much lower weight than 787, and the GEnx-2b from the 747-8 has the right thrust and bleed air necessary for a 767 derivative. So this would likely be something like a 767-300 or -400 fuselage (220-270 pax, dead center of “Middle of market”). New, advanced technology wings with GEnx-2b engines, advantages of twin aisle for longer 5000nm routes, and healthy demand for a freighter variant. On the other hand, this airframe likely has a commercial horizon of maybe 10-15 years. Pushing the envelope forward on newer architecture, build process, and materials may create a product with 35 year useful production run. In the current environment, dont expect any announcements of clean sheet aircraft any time soon.",/r/boeing/comments/htbifd/will_boeing_bring_back_the_757_in_place_of_797_nma/fygw37h/

boeing,"The 757 is interesting. It's design goes back to the 727.  The 727 was a very popular plane, but the airlines wanted it to carry more people and have a longer range.  Boeing tried to ""stretch"" it, but every redesign effort resulted in something that just didn't work.  So they designed the 757, a ""narrow body"" longer range plane.  It was a tremendous success. Yet, when they tried to ""stretch"" it into the 757-300, it was not successful enough to keep the production line profitable.  Just like there was no ""growth"" in the 727, there was not enough ""growth"" in the 757.  It is so surprising that there seems to be unlimited growth in the 737.",/r/boeing/comments/htbifd/will_boeing_bring_back_the_757_in_place_of_797_nma/fygnz8k/

Within a few months I got an offer for a C4608 CNC machine operator job.",/r/boeing/comments/hsbd3a/ltp_for_indemand_jobs/fy9zimd/
boeing,"Hey dude that's awesome! I started at the company not too long ago, going through the process myself. Personally I'm just planning to use it to learn things I've always been interested in but had no chance to learn before. They are not related to or applicable to my current job. Eventually they may for where I want to go in my career though, bit I can't really know, things always change. So I'd say you may have to think a little about what you want in the future, but even if you have no idea, pick something which sounds appealing and go with it. It's free education!

As someone else pointed out, a cert is a good way to get in without commiting too much, as a degree program has a 2-yr requirement after you're done. Also check the tax requirements - if you do an individual course you will be taxed over $5k of the course(s) you take. That won't apply for a cert if it is related to your job though, the definition of which you can probably make very broad since Boeing is so big. But you'd have to check. If it teaches you a new trade (engineer to lawyer for example) you would have to pay taxes on it. I called LTP and they were super helpful, I'd recommend that if you're thinking about it.",/r/boeing/comments/hsbd3a/ltp_for_indemand_jobs/fy9shu8/

boeing,"I would definitely be interested in the CS side of things, as the field is growing and lucrative, but it can seem pretty intimidating as I've never had much experience in it besides basic HS computer class.",/r/boeing/comments/hsbd3a/ltp_for_indemand_jobs/fy9iag4/
boeing,"Thanks for the response. I guess you could say I am looking to get into something like an A&amp;P cert, where I could move into assembly (I am in MMO right now as a PC on the factory floor and I've only had experience with other MTs) but honestly I dont have enough experience in anything aviation related to even begin to decide a pathway. I went to school for journalism and never saw myself working for Boeing until it just happened. Now that my foot is in the door I'm just trying to figure out how I can learn about the industry and what opportunities are out there. I know that's really vague but that's my starting point haha. Good news is there really isn't a pathway I would ""hate"" other than back breaking work in 100+ degree weather or sitting in a desk not moving for 8 hours.",/r/boeing/comments/hsbd3a/ltp_for_indemand_jobs/fy9hzzg/
boeing,"First off, good on you for utilizing LTP! Many people are just trying to ride this situation out, but now is an important time to improve your career, and LTP is a great resource.

Honestly, this question is way too broad. Are you looking for specifically in the aviation industry? What about corporate supporting unit for aviation (i.e. IT)? What do you enjoy doing? There's no point getting a degree and a job in something you hate. 

Google the in-demand degrees right now - CS is always one. Data science is too, but don't fall for the growth/supply inequity that is prevalent in hot degrees. Data science is growing a lot, but it's still really small, and the growth of supply is outdoing it. Similar to bioengineering a few years back. Do note - would love for someone in the data science field to correct me on this if I'm wrong. 

Certs are a great place to start - they won't take as long, improve your career a little bit, aren't subject to 2-yr requirements, and will expose you to a new field.

boeing,"From my experience, i graduated local community college with AS for Engineering degree.

Decided to get some certifications about aerospace assembly and machinist courses provided by few schools.

Got a job offer from minor company that paid bare minimum, stayed there for 3 years, and applied for job in Boeing, got interviewed 3 times in a row.

All I can say is, you need to look for what they want from these thousands applicants. If job is about assembly, its obvious they want someone somewhat experienced and have some knowledge about its environment. 

Most people I have talked to in Boeing all had some form of work experience! Even if it is not related with mechanical background, but it needs to have something related with its background, easiest one to gain is from certification course, which some courses only takes about 3-6months to complete. 

Make sure you make your resume right! They will literally spend 2 sec to look at your resume.(trust me, i am not even lying at all) Make it tight, short, clean, accurate!

But if you don't care about your happiness and you're just in it for the paycheck. Check out the  WATR center (Washington Aerospace Training &amp; Research Center) at Edmonds Community College. It's a technical training course that's specifically tailored to giving you the skills needed to work at a place like Boeing. They'll even go as far as helping you with your resume and interview training. That's what I did 6 years ago before I first started working for them, and I got hired almost immediately.

Other then that, Boeing does have a system in which your dad can go in and suggest you as an employee, like a referral program. Probably won't do much good now, but down the line that will be a big help along with him hounding some higher up friends of his. Nepotism is alive and real at Boeing.

boeing,"~~I’m going to guess that you are not a Boeing Everett worker.~~ Just read your comment history, looks like you’re not *currently* working there.

First of all, most of the planes being built right now at Everett are cargo planes. Passenger airlines are delaying or deferring orders, but the need for cargo planes has actually gone ***UP***. Passenger airlines actually fly tons of cargo, and with passenger flights down, cargo carriers need more capacity.

Also, just because it’s a really big building where manufacturing takes place doesn’t mean that it actually has a lot of manufacturing capability. There’s plenty of photos and videos online where you can get an idea of the the layout, but basically, there’s a lot of empty space that needs to be kept empty for moving around giant airplanes &amp; parts. There’s also a lot of heavy duty fixed machinery &amp; tooling that can’t be retooled to do anything else.

The larger and more complex a product is, the longer and slower the supply chain is, and the harder it is to change the product. 

There are definitely smaller shops and facilities Boeing has that could be re-purposed temporarily to make PPE or ventilators, but that’s not a cheap or easy thing to do, and wouldn’t make sense for Everett.

I managed to grab an interview by filling my resume/application with keywords and having references within Boeing, so using your dad on the application should get you in the door.  The rest is on you and depends on the position you are trying to land.  Know your stuff and lay it all out when they ask.  Every type of tool, computer program, every relatable project/job you've ever done... you can't oversell your prior experiences.

If you can swing it, an A&amp;P license is a solid investment, before or while you work at Boeing.  It makes you more desirable, and makes them pay you more.",/r/boeing/comments/hqvp9r/how_to_land_a_job_at_boeing/fy2bitz/

boeing,Apparently Triumph/Vought (big 747 subcontractors) have stopped producing parts so Boeing aren't taking new orders for the 747-8 unless the order number is guarantees to be around 100 I think. I don't think there's a freighter conversion program for the 747-8 because it's still relatively new but also the passenger versions can't receive the front nose loading door conversion.

boeing,I think though once I'm much older and with a family and want to settle down I will probably go back to hvac.

boeing,"I've heard blue and spaceX have similar atmosphere to Boeing to an extent. But Boeing is one of the worst at it. Blue and space have a very tough mission so in sense they can't afford to waste time on politics. While Boeing always thinks it's superior and thinks it has time while Airbus is innovating left right and center. 

As far as HVAC goes it is absolutely boring as shit lol. Just product development was really fun. And I worked at a Japanese company. My department was brand new. I was like one of the first 50 employees to the department as an intern and their first direct hire intern and we supported the whole world's product development. But japanese have a good way to making teams feel like small companies so we were challenged to design, test, and support builds and even support customers. I was traveling once a month atleast and towards the end of my time to China mostly. In July 2017 I spent 3 days at home and that was only due to 4th of July and an Ed Sheeran concert and the rest of it was traveling. But because of the broad job statement I was always under the pressure to get everything done fast and right so I learned a lot and grew. Engineers my age at Boeing I found don't even come close to the experience and knowledge and the ""engineers intuition"" I've developed (probably why I was a level 3 at Boeing). But HVAC also has a lot of politics for the fact the products are really well developed that projects aren't as fast paced. My company was playing catch-up even though it's the world's largest company for HVAC it has no footprint in the US so it was trying to catch up. But japanese companies often time you'll find out if you're not japanese your career growth has a very hard glass ceiling that's breakable, but very hard to break. While for the japanese folks that glass is made of sugar.",/r/boeing/comments/hmmi6l/laidoff_boeing_workers_to_get_extra_federal_help/fxi4em7/
boeing,Does the company have quotas to meet for female engineers?,/r/boeing/comments/hhz2g3/employeeemployment_question_thread_julyseptember/fxi49tf/
boeing,"Interesting you say that about HVAC. I've seen a lot of posts over in /r/askengineers about people wanting to get out because its boring haha. Probably some selection bias there though. 

Yeah I've already decided if/when I hop back into engineering, its going to be at a small company. I learned quickly here nothing kills my motivation and interest quicker than bureaucracy. PD and R&amp;D has always been the dream but its proving a lot harder to find than I ever thought. Though its hard to not at least glance at SpaceX and Blue's job postings. Boeing was my first real job in aerospace so I don't have a good measure how similar other aero companies are. I sort of figured any company in a field as highly regulated as aero is likely going to have lots of red tape. I really hope I'm wrong about that though.",/r/boeing/comments/hmmi6l/laidoff_boeing_workers_to_get_extra_federal_help/fxi3msb/
boeing,I start on Monday. I left Boeing this Monday and wanted to take a week break and just clear my head. The job sounds super technical. It's a new group and working on eletric hardware so a lot of thermal and structural correlation to deal with and having to meet defense and space standards is going to be tough. From what I heard from people in the company as well as people at Boeing that have worked there it's very technical.,/r/boeing/comments/hmmi6l/laidoff_boeing_workers_to_get_extra_federal_help/fxi2fgk/
boeing,From my data gathering and speaking to countless mentors brt and pd is where most of the technical work is. But if you want very technical work HVAC is a good field for it. But not the product support side. Product development. Or turbo machinery product development is super challenging. That's what I started my career out in and the trade shows for them are full of so many technical specialists. Small companies is the way to go for technical. That's what I'm going with. With spaceX and Blue Origin or tech companies being an exception for me in the larger side since they keep you technically engaged.,/r/boeing/comments/hmmi6l/laidoff_boeing_workers_to_get_extra_federal_help/fxi29hs/
boeing,Have you started at the new job yet? How are you liking it if so?,/r/boeing/comments/hmmi6l/laidoff_boeing_workers_to_get_extra_federal_help/fxi241w/
boeing,"My experience at Boeing wasn't the only thing pushing me towards taking a break but it definitely was the final straw I'd say. I've been desperately trying to find a technically challenging and interesting job since graduation with basically zero luck. Totally burnt out on sitting in meetings 70% of my work week, pushing papers, and pulling schedules out of my ass for random people. I have no doubt the sort of job I'd like exists *somewhere* within the behemoth that is Boeing but finding it will be hard.",/r/boeing/comments/hmmi6l/laidoff_boeing_workers_to_get_extra_federal_help/fxi22gd/
boeing,From what the experience at Boeing was for most new hires wanting to take a break or even swap professions is totally understandable. Lot of my old colleagues were Boeing and aerospace engineers in the 80s and early 2000s that got laid off and went to work at HVAC.,/r/boeing/comments/hmmi6l/laidoff_boeing_workers_to_get_extra_federal_help/fxi1i3r/
boeing,I can totally get that to be honest. I think it is risky for sure. But I mean if you have the means to and want to take a break who's to stop you. If anyone asks during interview you just have to properly explain the gap. It's the same when I'm asked why I left job X and so on. Atleast for me my job before Boeing which was my junior year internship turned part time for rest of college turned full time always has a spot for me back on the team so I can always fall back and go back to the winter wonderland that is Minnesota looool luckily I got something in Seattle so I can stay for a while.,/r/boeing/comments/hmmi6l/laidoff_boeing_workers_to_get_extra_federal_help/fxi1erd/
boeing,"Yep that experience was pretty much identical to mine. You're spot on about all the work being project management too. I know its risky to not be trying to jump back into the job market immediately right now the outlook being what it is but I'm banking my extra few years of experience giving me a bit of a leg up whenever I start applying. Hell, I'm really considering dropping engineering altogether for a while after my experience at Boeing.",/r/boeing/comments/hmmi6l/laidoff_boeing_workers_to_get_extra_federal_help/fxi168e/
boeing,"lol, a few of the fresh out of college guys in my group are taking that step. I feel so bad for these guys. Come into work to build skills. Get work that is just project management and so mundane it builds no skills. Then get laid off with 1 year or less experience and then trying to get a new job with that on your resume, not gonna be easy. And then on top of that add the fact most companies are so irresponsible they're barely surviving the pandemic and probably not looking to hire right now.

boeing,"Hi! I have a question for Boeing employees currently working from home. My dad (who I don't live with, check post history for context as to my own life) is wrapping up his last year or two of work before he retires at Boeing in Everett. (He is 70 next year.) He's been home since February (he has medical reasons to be home) and he's very stressed, he signs online at 6am and often not able to sign off until 4pm. He's told me he's unable to check personal email until after 6pm and so can only reply once or twice a day; texts are rare, we haven't had a phone call since last year (literally, it has been all texts). He takes naps, sometimes 2-3 a day, when he's really depressed (that amount of sleep happened once many years ago at a previous job) and he's doing it again. Just sleeping the whole weekend. Doesn't speak much about work, kinda complains. A lot. He used to LOVE going to the office. Just adored his vanpool, loved his coworkers. 

Boeing employees - especially those of you with 10+ at the company and older - is this...normal? Is the demands of ""Changes"" happening that stressful? Is it really that hard to read your email and text family? Do you go 3-4 days unable to check your email?

Feel free to DM. I just don't understand what is happening that is causing him to push his family away like this. Thanks :)",/r/boeing/comments/hhz2g3/employeeemployment_question_thread_julyseptember/fx7cwfk/

boeing,"Being of the same backgrounds and, seeing stuff like this, I can't imagine why managers are surprised that more people are not speaking up as we have company-sponsored discussions on racism.

To be clear, what has been going on is abhorrent and absolutely must stop.  I sincerely hope that this session of civil unrest does that the waves in the 1960s, the Rodney King riots, the Freddie Gray riots, the Ferguson riots, and many other demonstrations did not.  Fortunately, it looks like these are more widespread and are not so ridiculously thuggish (ref. looting in the LA riots post-Rodney King verdict) that they shut down more reasonable debate.  People seem to have finally understood how messed up things are and how much they need to change.

That said, the Overton window has shifted enormously on a variety of topics, and continues to move swiftly.  I am not in a financial position to lose my job, in a potentially very public way, over something that was 'reasonable' at the time it was said, and which is no longer considered ok at some arbitrary point in the future.  

I have been told for decades that my role, as a straight-and-of-southern-heritage-WASPy sort, was to be quiet and listen.

The MBAs and lawyers on the BOD couldn't care less about our lives. I will not be the next victim of Boeing incompetence and greed. I watched all the congressional hearings and the senate committee hearing and what I've heard scared me even more: the FAA can't do it job properly by lack of resources and qualified staff. They can't oversee properly what crooked Boeing does.
Since Boeing employees think the FAA are ""a bunch of idiots watching TV"", I have no trust in the certification process. 

Lots of pilots were not able to recover the plane fro a dive in the simulator. One of them, Mentour pilot, who has a very popular youtube channel removed the video of the sim. session when he crashed the plane in the exact same conditions as the Ethiopian pilots. He was able to recover the plane...

Unchanged body from middle of 20th century, from 60's and too big, too powerful, modern engines which are not compatible with the old frame....
This is not a mobile phone camera which you can fix with software patch.
There is many scientific articles stating that MAX should be never created because of the laws of physics. If is just wrong.

That would explain why MAX is still grounded since 2019 and why Boeing is under legal and criminal investigations.
Looks like someone wanted to save a lot of money by shortening the development process of a new model and was rushing with the sales by the decision of not making a whole new plane, starting with the drawing board but using the main parts from the old era and just upgrading some of them...
Not to mention things like hidden new additional software nobody was aware off, low quality parts and sensors from around the world without proper manufacture quality control etc... (the list is long)

It's a totally illegal aircraft with regard to the basic definition of Catastrophic and Hazardous systems and system redundancy.

This might be an unpopular opinion given it’s the Boeing subreddit but Boeing is not a good place to be a software engineer.

I don’t regret working here at all. I’m so happy I’ve made an impact on aviation, but money talks so find a middle ground.",/r/boeing/comments/hgwhmz/returning_back_to_boeing_thoughts/fwbapma/

Yeah if Boeing had the environment (don’t even care that much about pay) as Microsoft like open office and everything it would be a no-brainer.

I interviewed at Blue Origin and got rejected for their software/FPGA position back in October. I also don’t want to work 60 hours a week so it’s probably a blessing in disguise.

Your manager was mostly right that if you're looking for FPGA or software, you'll likely need to go to a supplier - though we do have Boeing Avionx. 
On my team with BCA, the engineers with FPGA and software experience are usually the compliance finders. This is still very different from being the ones to design and test at the lower level. Everyone else mostly supports from a systems aspect.",/r/boeing/comments/hgwhmz/returning_back_to_boeing_thoughts/fw6l5ro/
boeing,There’s a ton of good FPGA work going on at Boeing El Segundo and a bit in Seattle too. And last time I checked they have openings for this position. TC at Microsoft would be way better than Boeing though. Doesn’t microsoft also have FPGA work going on for their cloud?,/r/boeing/comments/hgwhmz/returning_back_to_boeing_thoughts/fw6k65e/
boeing,"It's a bit of both. The work culture here I don't find it fun, but being around airplanes is always fun, and that more than makes up for it. I'm not sure what's open right now for you since BCA is on a layoff frenzy. If you can find some software jobs in BDS I'd say sure. You're always at that risk when you're new though, if layoffs somehow affect your organization you're almost always the first one considered since you bring the least ""Boeing skills"". As far as software goes it's definitely a lot better to work on software that goes on airplanes than just servers.   


I'd say specifically look at Boeing Defense and Space if you want to come back here, otherwise, Blue Origin and the likes are looking for FPGA people. You may also want to try a company called MagniX they're an electric airplane company that's hiring a bunch of software people.   


Overall you are in a bit of  ""grass is greener"" mindset, but to be fair that's the same mindset that brought me here.

boeing,"&gt; It's not like the process of making the plane is going to reduce and the process won't change.

I'm a desk jockey, and on the defense side to boot, so I'm a poor source for insight on factory work...but this bit I've quoted seems quite contrary to the whole shebang of what's going on.  I am under the impression that several of our commercial programs ARE reducing the scope of the processes in order to reduce production rate.

If you are somehow the SOLE person who does a task within the entire enterprise, then I suppose you have a point.  But I would hazard to guess that for any given job code and level, there would be several personnel within the company that are knowledgable of the work, such that a given task doesn't need to be outright eliminated.  Likely that they won't *stop* projects, per se; merely slide schedule milestones to the right in order to account for reduced labor hours per cycle.

In my realm of things, the one guy I work closely with who got an ILO has been told that he has until July 1st to wrap up the project we'd been working, and needs to have a transition plan in place for his work tasks by July 17th. Then as of August, there will be no more development of the tool or process that he was in charge of, and I and another fellow or two will be left to pick up the maintenance of what the tool &amp; process are as of this summer, probably a handful of hours worth of activity for each of us to fit into our WIP each week, while (i'm spitballing here) some 20-hours worth of his work efforts will just cease as of his departure.",/r/boeing/comments/hcdxgl/manager_filing_for_extensions_for_certain_people/fviw63y/

For transparency's sake, I will say I did get ILOd so there may be a bit of saltiness from that in the way I go about explaining or questioning. I did get a job already so ILO doesn't matter at this point.    
However, say for example the mechanics getting laid off, how does that work? It's not like the process of making the plane is going to reduce and the process won't change. Now for me personally I'm a DE in the FSCC program. My project is one of the top for the airplane program, my FSCC team is being cut by 50%, but none of our projects are being stopped. So why did we have to lose so many people if our work is considered this important? Given we are contracted to only work 40 hours a week, giving each head twice the amount of work somehow doesn't add up to me.

boeing,"&gt;it's obvious that the flaws with this plane are greater than just MCAS because that would have been fixed by now.

The fix has taken so long because runaway stabilizer was recategorized as catastrophic by the FAA. This means anything (not just MCAS) that can cause runaway stab needs to have a less than 1 in 1 billion chance of happening. You may have heard about the wiring issues several months ago, which is related to the above. As far as the Seattle Times and Leeham says, the changes addressing MCAS specifically are the same as they were proposed 1 year ago.

Basically they needed to make major changes to the flight control system of the 737 to account for this recategorization. Oddly enough, non-MAX 737's will continue flying around with the old system, where runaway stab has never killed or injured anyone over 52 years.

You are right, but also totally missing the point. 

When you build airplanes, it shouldn't be possible for any one idiot, or even two idiots to mess up and it matter. The process should be so good that this can't happen. When things like this happen, it's not a sign that people are stupid and lazy, people ARE stupid and lazy. The process and thus the company is broken. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the company is broken, then everything they say is untrustworthy. If the ""check for ladders in the fuel tanks"" process doesn't work, how do we know the guys who checked the fuel lines really verified that the seals will hold up to thousands of pressurizations without failing?

Literally every day, for every problem, you have the chance to go out to the line, talk to the operators, and check out the issue. If you are aftermarket support, or supplier support you will do a lot more over the interwebs. With that being said aftermarket LE's travel to their production locations so as long as you are good with traveling the world to play with broken airplane parts and repair battle damage than the over the webs thing isn't much of an issue. haha. My girlfriend is actually a test engineer and she says it's very dependent on the test you are working.  She estimates 30-50% is hands on working with the component. The rest of the time is documentation, and test planning. You also as a test engineer work with the shop floor for your testing area so they are in charge of building all the test rigs you help design.

 In general I'm handling parts all day long and working closely with production to disposition the non-conforming parts. In our shop, we have a teardown/inspection team who writes the NCR (non-conformance record) and the LEs apply repair methodologies to write dispositions. This tells our backshops how to fix those discrepancies and return the part to a serviceable state. 

I love my job. Cubicle land was hell for me. I feel much more at home in a noisy shop environment. I work with inspectors and mechanics all day. It's a quicker pace since we support our production line, but I always felt the sense of urgency was lacking in my previous office job.

Not trying to justify racist behavior, but I can only imagine how natural and reactionary it is for other people to just keep falling down that vein rather than stop, think, and accept that your bias affects you and it takes work to overcome.

Software Engineers are represented by SPEEA, as such all of our salaries are a matter of public record.  The chart that I linked shows the salary breakdown by number of years at Boeing and your engineering level.

I came in right out of college (with military experience in the past) at $82,000 a year.  After my first year my salary was adjusted by 3.3% bringing my salary to $84,706 a year.  That salary adjustment is something that happens every year in March and is based off a number of factors; including how other Software Engineers are paid across the sector, how well Boeing does, and how well I do in my personal accomplishments (merit.)

No one that is training us knows what’s going on and they’re moving people from BCA harnesses to the other areas.

I’m a bit concerned. While I certainly understand everyone has to pay their dues but how do I bring up that I am open to other positions within the company? As it stands as our managers option is to either A put us in one of two wire harness areas or B put us in warehouse.

boeing,"&gt;What's sad is that Boeing could have launched a clean sheet design

This proves you have no real understanding of the issue. **Boeing going with a clean sheet design would be Airbus' wildest wet dream, far greater than even the MAX crashes.** It was the start of a replacement cycle for every airline and every major 737 operator was seriously threatening to go to the Neo if they didn't get a MAX ASAP, especially after American actually pulled the trigger. Given that delivery time is the factor here, let's do a quick analysis of the situation:

Let's make the very conservative estimate that the NSA(737 replacement) would enter service 2 years after the MAX did (in reality this would probably be 4 or 5 more years). Assuming that Airbus would maintain the 60 plane/month rate on the Neo, that is 1200 Neo's that would be produced before the first MAX was delivered. 

In the best case scenario, 1200 orders on the MAX backlog go to Airbus. That is **73 billion USD** in revenue (1200*121.8 *10^6 MAX 8 price* 0.5 customary discount) that Boeing loses to a competitor. For reference, the MAX debacle will cost Boeing around 25 billion USD and the Max development program cost around 3 billion USD.


That's a lot of cash lost, right? But realize this is the **best case scenario.** One of the primary drivers for building the MAX was that exclusively 737 airlines like Southwest and Ryanair, who happen to be some of the biggest customers, were on the brink of adding A320's. This would have been utterly devastating, as airlines are incentivized to stick with one type or manufacturer due to significant training and maintenance costs. Once another plane is added, this cost is eaten and there is far less incentive to stick with a single manufacturer. Losing your exclusive customers and the associated market share could cost untold billions in future sales on top of the 73 billion already lost. And let's remember, this is losing market share in by far the largest segment of the airliner industry. No way in hell widebody sales can make up for that.


At this point, it should be abundantly clear that a new plane was financial suicide. That too is the case from a performance perspective. It is almost certain that the 737 replacement would need to consist of majority composite materials in order to be competitive as the workhorse of Boeing for the next 30 years. No manufacturer in the world, including Boeing and Airbus, can currently produce composite aircraft fast enough to match (non-coronavirus impacted) demand in the narrowbody sector. And this is already 7 years after the Neo and MAX programs launched. Had Boeing gone ahead with the NSA, they would have likely rushed out some half-baked composite plane that wouldn't be particularly efficient or manufacturable. **Airbus then just sits there with 70% or greater market share in the largest segment of the airliner industry and shovels all that extra time and money into the A320 replacement, which comes out 10 years later and wipes the floor with the NSA.** Boeing then dies after losing most of the airliner market to Airbus.

In case this isn't abundantly clear by now: **No, a clean sheet design was not an option for Boeing. The MAX was inevitable.** How MCAS was designed is another issue and another essay, but the decision to launch the MAX was certainly justified.

&gt;The A220 will out sell the MAX before it's over.

&gt;Mr. Pierson, who is scheduled to testify at a House Transportation Committee hearing on the two 737 Max crashes, called on Boeing to shut down the Max production line last year. But the company kept producing planes and did not make major changes in response to his complaints....Executives were pressuring workers to complete planes despite staff shortages and a chaotic factory floor.... Mr. Pierson retired in August 2018, partly because he was uncomfortable with the conditions in the 737 factory.




management chose not to include certain features in the planes and run the way the company the way it is being run - if anyone is to blame for the greater part of all this it would be them to which I would agree with. do you think its reasonable and not in anyway disrespectful and condescending  to the 10s of thousands of employees who did their job honetly to the highest standard, who had no part in choosing to include those extra safety fetaures (or whatever they were) on the plane and voiced their displeasure off the way things are run?

boeing,"&gt;So according to you, Board members should not understand the issues and what is at stake when they make a decision and sign off on projects? Proper oversight starts by a deep understanding of the products.

Nope, that is not what I wrote.  The RAA of board members in a publicly traded company is primarily fiduciary in nature. When you speak of signing off on projects and design decisions, you are thinking of a Chief Technology Officer.  The senior chief engineers in Boeing and VPs of engineering that report to the CTOs contribute to and execute most of the technical vision.

A board is required by incorporation law that roughly states ""a board of at least three members shall manage the company""... so by definition they are more managers than anything else. Many times members of boards are on multiple company and non profit boards.  It is worth scrutinizing the role of boards in america and why companies pay these figureheads exorbitant amounts .... or why a politician like Nikki Haley could be allowed on Boeing's Board - and how it relates to favorable business deals Boeing got in her state.  

It is not reasonable to expect the board of any company to have technical skills related to the manufacture of their product. You're looking at the wrong level.

That would be Ray Conner as CEO of BCA before McAllister.  He started as a mechanic, so he probably knew a little about planes.  

You know what I think the original sin is here? Money.  But not in the way you think.  Have you seen how little the safety engineers at the FAA get paid? The FAA can't afford great engineers or enough engineers to provide oversight.  You said: ""Proper oversight starts by a deep understanding of the products."" I agree with that in the context of proper technical oversight.

boeing,"Global scrutiny and that accountability to congress are a plus. EASA isn't just going to take FAA's word on anything to do with the 737, which is a plus for consumers.

You have a right to chose not to fly on a boeing commercial aircraft.  Exercise it all you want when shopping for tickets.  But airlines are going to buy whatever is cheapest (purchase + operating cost) to fly a route.  What plane flies a route is subject to change at anytime due to delays or maintenance.  So be vigilant because the 737 MAX will be flying a lot of routes and soon.  

I don't need a board member to be able to write a line of MISRA, work on a matlab model, or even be able to read a diagram. Thats not their job.  What do you think a board member does?

Wiring issues, good thats closer to evidence based thinking. There are miles of very important wires in a plane. What exactly is wrong with the wires? If a plane is found to have burs or debris from the manufacturing process where they might rub on a wire, then it gets fixed, other planes get inspected to see if they are affected too, and the process that lead to that problem gets re-assessed to prevent it in the future.  S.O.P.

Now maybe you are referring to the hot wire short theoretical issue. Story is that the 737 has a power wire too close (it is against FAA standards) to the control wires for the horizontal tail. FAA says its against the rules.  Boeing says it hasn't ever been a problem. They consider it low risk because there would have to be a fault first and then the distance comes into play and there is still okay, but not up to spec, separation. In my humble opinion the FAA needs to sack up and tell Boeing to eat the cost and move the wires.  Then the FAA needs to inspect the shit out of it, because that sort of retroactive change can actually introduce all sorts of room for errors and failure (see the burrs up above).  

Boeing found and reported the wiring separation issue as part of a re evaluation safety.  They aren't hiding it.  They are just asking FAA if they really have to make the change.",/r/boeing/comments/h02v2r/do_any_of_you_feel_guilty/ftliiec/

Shareholders are the main priority and your current CEO is a bean-counter, not an engineer. It tells me all I need to know about his priorities.
In addition, the board members are people who have no actual technical skills: how did that work out for Boeing, hmm? Finally, the former chief pilot mocked pilots who wanted more training and deceived the FAA with 0 remorse. He is not in jail as far as I know.

Has anybody else ever gotten an email like that as a part of your hiring process? It seems after reading through a couple of these threads that the hiring process can vary widely across different jobs, but I haven't seen anybody talk about getting something like this.",/r/boeing/comments/fzylh9/employment_related_question_thread_aprjun_2020/ftl38gf/

boeing,"Like I said if you truly wanted to learn about what happened in these crash planes listen to the other side. The media and politicians picked their side and no amount of evidence against it would make them change that. 

These guys in the pod have literally 100 years combined working as crash investigators for the NTSB. They don’t let Boeing completely off the hook in some areas but give ultimate fault to airline ground crews, pilots, and those regulatory agencies in said airlines flight areas that let everyone down by accepting a sub par safety culture. All of this is out of Boeing’s control and will always be.

Bet the Seattle times didn’t report that the lion air ground crews omitted a functional test for the new AOA  (not supplied by Boeing) because it was ~raining~. Or that the same fault occurred on the crash plane the day prior and nothing was done to the plane for its next flight.

You're just as guilty of killing 346 people as everybody you're accusing if you really think one person at Boeing is responsible. 

You buy plane tickets for companies that fly Boeing planes; you pay taxes that pay for Boeing aircraft; you use the internet that rides on Boeing satellites. That means you're just as culpable if you think Boeing employees are. You killed 346 people just as much as anybody else did. Don't you feel even a modicum of guilt for your travesty?

boeing,"Not gonna lie, it’s kinda funny to call a plane with composites half baked. Cause parts of it were actually baked. Less than half in my estimate though. What’s the most complicated thing you’ve ever built? I’ve worked on parts of the ISS and a 737 is more complex in many ways. What’s the most rigorous safety certification process for an embedded system you’ve gone through? How long have you worked in software testing that you can suddenly prove an absence of bugs and flaws?
Before the Challenger exploded low level engineers at Thiokol tried to raise concerns up the ladder about the o rings and were ignored. They argued with their executives and NASA and were overruled due to politics and other pressure like schedule. 
Is there any evidence that the MCAS problem was known and intentionally ignored? The MCAS was built to Boeing spec by Collins. Did someone have a failure of imagination in the design or in the testing process to come up with the specific failure modes that could lead to unintended extended MCAS activation? The fact that most of the BCA and FAA brain trust has been working on this for over a year should be clear evidence of the complexity.",/r/boeing/comments/h02v2r/do_any_of_you_feel_guilty/ftk8e7c/

I recently learned that there are some wiring problems but they don't want to fix them. Those corrupt and worthless MBAs and executives should be locked up, Some of them deserve the death penalty in my opinion. 

I tell all my friends and acquaintances to avoid that plane, should it be back in service. Otherwise, death will be right around the corner, it's another crash waiting to happen.

boeing,"First point is baseless and so I will ignore it. The MAX is the best 737 Boeing has ever made seeing multiple productions in my time there. 

MCAS was based on one AOA vein and relies on the pilot and first officer to understand if the veins are in disagree. The classic AOA disagree statement everyone rages about is actually just a different customer option that makes the notification larger on the screen at the sacrifice of other statuses. That’s right there always an AOA disagree notification on the screen it’s just a software change if they want it bigger which is a preference. 

If you truly wanted to learn about these crashes you would listen to the mentioned podcast and see how little the public was told about these crashes.",/r/boeing/comments/h02v2r/do_any_of_you_feel_guilty/ftjtmbh/
boeing,"It's not a troll post. 

The point is that Boeing tried to build a vastly inferior plane to the A32XNeo in a matter of neglectful haste.

Nothing else explains the idiocy of MCAS based on one sensor with NO FREAKING redundancy! How much redundancy is built into EVERY other aircraft system? A simple ""AOA Disagree"" light may have saved some 350 lives.",/r/boeing/comments/h02v2r/do_any_of_you_feel_guilty/ftjt1lo/
boeing,"I know this is just troll bait but please educate yourself. Here is a comment from a previous discussion.


I know this will get downvoted to oblivion but Boeing employees should do themselves a favor and research the actual facts of each crash plane. It’s widely agreed upon outside of politics that both crashes were a direct result of maintenance and pilot errors. Could Boeing have made systems easier for pilots to identify and disable? Sure. But part of being a pilot is recognizing in flight anomalies and both crews did a terrible job of that.

Listen to a podcast called “The Flight Safety Detectives” hosted by two lifelong NTSB investigators. Politicians and the media used Boeing for sound bites instead of actually fixing the problem of lower aircraft safety standards in other countries.

Edit: This is the first time bringing up this topic on r/boeing without being immediately dismissed by many who read it. Hopefully people will see that Boeing can be both a terrible money hungry corporation while also making planes that truly haven’t sacrificed safety.

I was called by someone from the ""End User Computing"" group 4 business days after the post, who said that he'd gotten a report of concerns over a post on the Insite Group Boeing Dank Memes.  He then pulled it up, and gave me a bit of a ""I get the dark humor, but there are concerns about the gun violence"" chat.  He offered to help me edit it, but I asked if he could just remove it altogether, as I wasn't concerned with sharing the opinion, merely going for a laugh. It was removed that day.

8 business days after the post, my manager informed me that he'd been notified of a security threat investigation naming me as a security concern.  

On the 10th business day, a corporate investigator interviewed me and had me virtually sign a statement acknowledging the facts of the content within the post, and attesting that I meant no threat of any kind, and that the post was made in ill conceived humor.  My boss said there were fair odds I'd get a CAM, and it usually comes with a day's suspension.

On the 14th business day, I was served the CAM with a 5-day unpaid suspension.  The CAM itself was fairly vaguely worded, just stating that I'd made a post on an internal Boeing site that contained inappropriate violent content, and then had the Boeing Behaviors descriptions regarding employee performance written out.  I took the suspension for the duration of the following pay period.

I do also regret that I didn't check out the viewership stats before the post was removed.  My assumption that someone reported it is based on it having had something 60some bumps when I got the call, which indicates a fair number of folk viewed it, and the fact that it took a few days for it to be flagged.

• Will receive a lump-sum payment of one week of pay for every year of service (up to a maximum of 26 weeks of pay),

• Are eligible to receive a continuation of medical insurance for up to six months after date of layoff, and

• Will forfeit recall rights and lose seniority (the same as those accepting the lump sum payment option on regular layoff benefits or those who retire from Boeing). Therefore, anyone requesting the voluntary layoff should be certain they will not return to Boeing in the future.

• If more individuals apply for voluntary layoff than the allocated reductions, requests will be approved based on employees with the highest seniority.

• Those approved will be coded as being laid off, for the purposes of reporting to the state Employment Security Department. However, there are specific rules that may limit unemployment insurance benefits for those laid off, who then receive retirement benefits.

boeing,"I got contacted by a recruiter for Lockheed Martin the very same day that Dave Calhoun announced that ILOs were going to happen at the end of April. It was pretty serendipitous. I was in a pretty bad mental state after that day at work so I figured what the hell, I'll apply. Let's see what happens. Well, 8 days later I had a job offer. 

I would have had to move across country and taken a slight pay cut. But I told my manager that I had a job offer that I was considering taking, but I would much prefer to stay at Boeing and I asked if there was anything he could say that I could count on to help me make the decision to stay. 

He told me that  he would be genuinely surprised if my skill code got hit much worse than it already was, although it wasnt in his direct control, obviously. The amount that got WARNs last week was already really high and we're bordering on a staffing level that is pretty close to crippling productivity and we likely cant afford to lose much more without falling behind on a ridiculous amount of work. He said there was a decent buffer of people between me and the bottom of the rankings after the ILOs and VLOs take effect since they didnt cut all the R3s. He basically said that based on his awareness of the situation, I should be okay this time around. 

It was a 50/50 decision between accepting the offer or staying at Boeing, but I decided that I would roll the dice and stay here. I wouldn't have felt good about either decision.

Supply and demand is a bitch if you are the supply and demand doesn’t rise. 


So no. I’m not looking. I’ll end up back in the field I was working in pre-Boeing so that I can avoid the supply glut. But for now I’m letting the dust settle and figuring out the plan. My wife’s job went away too so there are a ton of variables.

People who got notice last week will be leaving late July. People who get notice at the end of this month will leave end of August... and so on. 

The director of structures engineering sent out an email a few weeks ago saying there would likely be a handful more layoffs in Q3 this year for BCA engineering, but it was unknown if it would affect structures engineer job codes specifically. If they get WARNs in Q3 then they would be leaving at the end of the year. 

I talked to my manager yesterday and he said that engineering already has gotten hit really hard (~18% company wide) and that if they cut much more that work wouldn't get done. Not sure if upper management knows that... 

He didnt give me any official promises, but he said that where I stand in the retention rankings that he didnt expect I'd get hit relative to the additional layoffs that my skill code could reasonably endure without completely crippling productivity.

boeing,"I have recently (from late Feb to now) applied for a few jobs on the Defense side at Boeing. For the first two I was already informed that I was not selected to move forward, but for the third one I received an email the next day with this in the body:

&gt; Thank you for your time in completing this process. Please click here to login to Careers at Boeing to complete the Conflict of Interest questionnaire. The questionnaire must be completed in order for your application to move forward to the next steps.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Please connect with your Talent Acquisition Advisor with any questions. 

I never got anything like this with the other jobs I applied for. Does this mean that this application is moving forward, at least more than the other two? Or could it be that the other two just did not require the questionnaire to be filled out? And with that last sentence saying to connect with my Talent Acquisition Advisor with any questions, I have not be assigned or contacted by any Talent Acquisition Advisor, is that just a blanket statement, or should I know who that is?

&amp;#x200B;

Another question regarding this job. The posting for the job was already taken down, less than a week after it was initially posted, but my profile on Workday says I am still under consideration. Does this mean that they already received enough applicants that they feel like moving forward with or is the job just not there anymore?

I can’t remember top of my head but it’s broken down based on your competencies, knowledge of products, knowledge of certification, engineering/relevant skills, and then name recognition was a category as well. Your manager gets 2 minutes to cover all of this about you and then they vote for your retention level and where you sit within that level. Now in my case my manager never read my resume (he admitted this), so I was screwed either ways lol.

Obviously due to ESGR they have to maintain your job or similar but in my experience Boeing has gone beyond the requirements which makes sense given their military contracts.

And worked my ass off in one place to another to get here so I can make the next plane that makes the next kid go from shithole to something better. I had a stable job in my last company. Everyone loved me. Everyone trusted me. They were grooming me to be a manager and more in the future. They sent me to all these places to be trained and whatever I felt I needed to learn they paid for. But I still left it cuz I loved airplanes that much. I didn’t want the money I didn’t want any of it just to design airplanes and make them not fall out of the sky and give people the same joy I get out of them. And within a year (hell 6 months since I got retention then), none of it matters and just ripped away. And then they have the audacity to ask me to speed up my project and get done before I leave.

Many of us want change in more ways than you could understand as an outsider who has never worked for this company could understand. I also know that real change starts at the lowest levels and works its way up. In fact I will say this, one of the managers who I felt was giving the 737 incident lip service only attention and not trying to learn from those mistakes, was given a ILO. The other managers who have taken that incident to heart are the still working, and their teams have had the fewest, if none, laid off.

It's the same thing at my company. You can get hired on as a senior engineer(seems like y'all's level 4 equivalent) if you have 8 years of Eng experience (or 6w/PE). However, it's tough to move up internally through the engineering progressions I.e. rather than reward you for meeting expectations you get it held as a carrot in front of you - ultimately getting promoted later than an external hire would come in as with the same years experience.",/r/boeing/comments/fzylh9/employment_related_question_thread_aprjun_2020/fs82eri/

boeing,Where do i aquire this knowledge?,/r/boeing/comments/gsjnej/when_you_think_you_are_safe/fs7zrk4/
boeing,"Possibly, especially if that's yet another year of work experience under your belt.  I would say that having it before you're hired and as early in your career as possible is how to get the biggest payoff.  For example, I know of a few young guys that had no experience but got hired as lvl 2 engineers bc they had their masters.  Meanwhile, a new hire without a masters might work for 3 or 4 years before going to lvl 2.  Even later, as like a lvl 4, you could get your masters and basically no one even knows or cares.

I started to get mine and it's all initiated on your own.  You don't need managers approval etc.  So while I was doing my first coarse I had one Thursday or something when I left work early to finish some work that had to be uploaded by 5pm iirc.  Anyways the next day I basically got chewed out a little when I mentioned to my manager that the reason I left early was for school. It wasn't that bad but basically he didn't care at all if I got my masters and said something to the tune of it won't help me do my job any better (which is pretty true).  I stopped doing it when I was talking to another guy who had just graduated and said that literally nothing happens when you graduate... it's not like they call you into a room to tell you you're getting a raise.  I do suppose that once you have it it could help boost you to a lvl 3 slightly faster.  Hopefully some others can chime in and verify.  Like I said above, I didn't finish.  

Sorry that's long winded.  There is one advantage though to getting a masters while at boeing: they will pay for it.  Also, in general I certainly wouldn't encourage you to not get a masters.  I wish I had finished bc it helps pad your resume and gives me more opportunities if/when I'm looking for a new job.",/r/boeing/comments/fzylh9/employment_related_question_thread_aprjun_2020/fs7zhdr/

does anyone have any knowledge about the assistance programs and/or severance packages? when i was getting hired on friends i made would always say things like ""and worst case scenario you get laid off, get put on a callback list, and they'll pay for your school while you wait"" but checking the IAM751 website it looks like their only approved vendors are highly specialized (useless) vocational programs or whatever (cosmetology/truck driving/resume training)  


I was hoping to start a career path towards electrical engineering or robotics or something -not truck driving. Anyone know of how any of this works, I'm back at work soon and will be talking to career advisors soon but, just to ease my mind till then I would be ecstatic if anyone can feed me some info.

boeing,"I'll bite since you're clearly trying to antagonize people going through a rough time. What sources and evidence do you have to backup your claim? 

Every regulatory body has their eyes on the MAX and Boeing has gone through the engineering with a fine tooth comb to fix anything that might remotely cause a problem. This will no doubt be the safest airplane to ever fly. To think otherwise would be pretty ignorant since the company's future is staked in a successful return to service of the MAX. Boeing has self-reported additional findings that they have committed to fix. 

Furthermore, not absolving the Boeing of any design mistakes made, but the airlines are also at least equally to blame. Poor maintenance and pilot training standards played a major role in the crashes.  If you're interested in educating yourself read the article below. The MAX crashes are not a simple black and white blame game. It is pretty complex and nuanced situation that can't be summed up in the headlines.

boeing,My project is top 25 for 777 production. I have multiple managers wanting my personal email and LinkedIn so as soon as they can hire they want me back. But my manager didn’t like that I asked him questions or didn’t think I had experience releasing drawings  even tho it’s literally the first bullet that I was the release focal at my last job (🤣).

You mentioned you are halfway through your masters.

If the salary isn’t where you want it to be, the LTP might help offset the difference.

At my current company, they have levels more or less as a placeholder and hire according to experience. Is this the case with Boeing?

boeing,"I would say with 5 years you COULD be qualified for a level 3 position. However, you mentioned you interviewed for a position already.

Look at the job posting, it should have a job code listed near the bottom (6H6HI2 would be for a level 2 manufacturing engineer because it ends in a 2). 

The level is non-negotiable, but if you believe you bring more added value to the table then you could try to negotiate salary. I’m not sure the dynamics behind that given the current economic state.",/r/boeing/comments/gpzc0y/engineer_level_question/frpr0c6/

I don't know anybody at my site that has their PE (or if they do they don't talk about it) but that doesn't mean your site or at least your hiring manager wouldn't find it valuable.

boeing,"The way retentions benefit senior people is that you automatically get one retention level bump if you've been with the company for 20 years and two level bumps if you've been here for 30 years, which is really stupid for people like us who are newer. I can think of about 3 people in my group who have been at Boeing for 20+ years and aren't worth anything productivity-wise. Absolutely just dead weight and everyone who works with them knows it. Crappy thing is that with the SPEEA contract, they're at least R2. They're almost definitely lower in the R2 stack relative to the other R2s, so if you earned your R2, there is probably a layer of useless old timers between you and a layoff. 

As for any R3s that are sweating right now, I like to think that the 10% flexibility is so that management can save newer hires who show potential to get these people who have slipped through the cracks for multiple decades.
