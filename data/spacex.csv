# Welcome to the r/SpaceX ANASIS-II Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shahar603, your launch host for this mission[.](https://airbus-h.assetsadobe2.com/is/image/content/dam/products-and-solutions/space/telecommunication/eurostar/ANASIS-II_shipment_Copyright_Airbus.jpg?wid=1920&amp;fit=fit,1&amp;qlt=85,0)

## Overview

ANASIS-II is a South Korean military communications satellite, built by Airbus Defense and Space and operated by South Korea's Agency for Defense Development. Based on the Eurostar-3000 platform the satellite will operate in geostationary orbit and provide wide coverage over the Korean Peninsula. A Falcon 9 rocket will deliver the spacecraft to a geostationary transfer orbit and the booster will land on a drone ship downrange.

Per the customer's request, live coverage will end shortly after first stage landing.

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX GPS III SV03 (Columbus) Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

Hello everybody, I am u/Marc020202, and it has been a while since I hosted the last thread!

**Mission Overview** 

This mission launches the third GPS III satellite into orbit and is the second GPS launch for SpaceX. Although the GPS III SV01 launch aboard Falcon 9 expended the booster, this mission's booster will be recovered via ASDS landing. The destination orbit, however, is unchanged. SpaceX is also planning to launch at least 3 further GPS III missions.

# Primary Mission: Deployment of payload into the correct orbit

Since the press kit for this Mission has not been released yet, it is not 100% clear how the mission will be executed, however, it is likely that like the GPS SV1 mission back in 2018 the Second stage will target a parking orbit first, before Igniting the Merlin Vacuum engine again, boosting the satellite into a 20200km by 1200km Orbit with an inclination of 55Â°. The first stage engine burn will likely be a bit shorter to save fuel to allow B1060 to reenter and land.

At the start of thread #12 Starship SN5 has just moved to the launch site and is preparing for testing. Starship SN6 consists of a fully stacked propulsion section at the assembly site. Starship test articles are expected to make several suborbital hops in the coming months beginning with a 150 meter hop and progressing toward a 20 km hop. Orbital flight requires the SuperHeavy booster, for which [a new high bay is soon to be erected](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1269418186757206016 'Tweet by @elonmusk'). SpaceX continues to focus heavily on development of its Starship production line in Boca Chica, TX.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starhip development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

spacex,"#[We're pleased to announce, Dr. Robert Zubrin will be returning to r/SpaceX for another AMA next Saturday in conjunction with The Mars Society.](https://i.imgur.com/QBmST0K.png)

While I'm sure that Dr. Zubrin needs no introduction for most of us here, for those of you who are new, [Dr. Zubrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zubrin) is of course the Mars Society President and one of the founders since 1998. Earth's most famous and passionate advocate for Mars, backing that energy with serious engineering knowledge, working on hundreds of space exploration and nuclear tech research papers, including the famous [Mars Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct) mission! He has also authored or co-authored over a dozen books, just last year publishing [The Case for Space](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HDSSKHJ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0). (My favourite is [The Case for Mars](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Mars-Plan-Settle-Planet/dp/145160811X), but I highly recommend both books.) Not to mention literally hundreds of interviews on the subject (many available on youtube). Zubrin has spent his considerable talents towards figuring out exactly how to get to Mars for decades; With SpaceX being created with nearly the sole purpose of getting humanity to Mars, there is a deep shared purpose, with Dr. Zubrin keenly watching SpaceX from the start with as much interest as any of us, even helping shape Musk's passion for Mars as a destination.

With more than a week until the AMA, I recommend checking out [last year's AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/e0kqpk/im_robert_zubrin_ama_noon_pacific_today/) which was a wealth of information. Of course, any of his books are highly recommended. More recently, there is [this 2 parter interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwdipsDsQYs) directly about SpaceX, Musk and how they change our path to Mars. Recently Zubrin has also penned numerous [articles](https://spacenews.com/op-ed-toward-a-coherent-artemis-plan/) analyzing the lunar [Artemis plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program) which SpaceX has recently become a part of with Dragon XL and Starship HLS contracts in the early stages. Dr. Zubrin also spoke with Musk at Boca Chica as recently as February and wrote about that [here](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/02/mars-elon-musk-plan-to-settle-red-planet/?fbclid=IwAR3HY65gnvLUZQsOdAkksEF4PCF1Aql3VJflaIAugd2C6inFdG8lDdP7RbM). While a week is not enough to read a fraction of Dr. Zubrin's work, I hope most of you will check some of it out prior to the AMA, it is inspiring stuff!

Looking forward to another solid AMA!

-----

Special thanks to Edward Heisler and Lucinda Offer of The Mars Society ( https://www.marssociety.org/ ) for helping put together this AMA. You can get involved without ever leaving reddit on r/MarsSociety . They also have their [**23rd** annual international convention](https://www.marssociety.org/conventions/2020/) happening on Oct 15~18 which is online this year and free to join, a good chance to further get involved in getting our asses to Mars.",/r/spacex/comments/hbk3ob/how_to_get_to_mars_dr_zubrin_ama_saturday_27th/

#Starlink-9 (STARLINK V1.0-L9)

## Overview

The tenth Starlink launch overall and the ninth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy 58-60 Starlink satellites into an elliptical orbit roughly 25 minutes into the flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. This mission includes the second rideshare on a Starlink mission, with [two of BlackSky's satellites on top of the Starlink stack](https://spacenews.com/blacksky-launching-two-satellites-on-june-starlink-mission/). The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 632 km downrange.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather, and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

spacex,"What an awesome launch, just like always! As I was reading the stats about everything, this launch seemed especially interesting from a financial perspective. The new elements (ride-share with Skysat and foregoing a static fire) stand out to me as not just technically interesting, but also potentially financially interesting:

1. Skysat is a paying customer. It's well-known that SpaceX's internal costs for launching boosters are likely well-below what they charge commercial customers...but it still does cost them money. By dropping 2 Starlink satellites and making room for a few Skysat ride-shares, they're now lowering their own internal launch costs. I have no idea by how much, Skysat just said they got a ""good deal"", so I'm guessing that's probably somewhere between $1-5 million.

2. No static fire test. While this seems like just an efficiency boost (which it is), it's also a non-zero cost. The have to get their crew onsite, they likely have to pay to get NASA/FAA people onsite, they have to fuel the vehicle, pay for cryogenics, etc. This all seems trivial, and when you have a rocket launching for $150 million it is; but when you have a rocket that can be launched multiple times, decreasing its per-launch price each time it goes up, you have to start looking for financial savings elsewhere.

SpaceX appears to just really aggressively to be looking for any way to (safely) cut cost-per-flight down. This is similar to catching their fairings, which are a rounding-error on expendable launches, but actually do start to add up when you're reusing your rockets.

All this to say, this is why I think SpaceX is so much better positioned to build something like Starlink, and why I really don't think there will ever be other competitors. They already have 500+ satellites in orbit when their next closest competitor just declared bankruptcy, and the next closest after that just issues press-releases about their plans and performs one sub-orbital flight every year. Meanwhile, SpaceX is aggressively getting their launch costs down and putting 100+ satellites in orbit per month.",/r/spacex/comments/h8ah79/starlink_the_ocho_launch_seems_to_be_really/

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 8 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shaha603, your host for this mission[.](https://i.redd.it/ck3ipxff9c451.png)

**Mission Overview**

The ninth Starlink launch overall and the eighth operational batchâ  of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy 58 satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. Riding along are 3 SkySat satellites launched for planet labs. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.
Half of Falcon 9âs fairing previously flew on the JCSAT-18/Kacific1 mission, and the other half previously flew on SpaceXâs third Starlink mission. 

â  The first Starlink mission launched a batch of prototype satellites that do not form part of the operational constellation.

spacex,"Potentially huge good news for Starlink:

1. FCC will hold an auction in October 29 to award $16B subsidy over 10 years for building up broadband infrastructure for rural America.

2. The auction has two latency tiers high and low, the low latency tier requires latency to be less than 100ms, and vendors in this tier will have a big advantage in auction.

3. SpaceX has been arguing Starlink can meet this latency threshold, but since they (and all the other LEO constellation) are not in commercial service yet, there're proposals to forbid them from bidding on low latency tier at all.

4. Less than a months ago, FCC released a document stating LEO constellation is not allowed to bid on the low latency tier, this would make it difficult for Starlink to get significant amount of subsidy from this program.

5. Today FCC took a vote on whether to go ahead with the auction, it looks like just before the vote they changed their stands on the issue and now allows LEO constellation like Starlink to bid on low latency tier.

6. In order to get the subsidy, Starlink still need to prove its latency to FCC's satisfaction and will need to face off the other broadband providers in the auction, but this could potentially allow Starlink to get significant amount of subsidy (i.e. multiple of billions) from this program, it could be a huge boost for Starlink and Starship in terms of funding.

References:

1. [Chairman Ajit Pai's statement](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/060962555534/DOC-364811A2.pdf):

    &gt; And, at the request of one of my fellow commissioners, **we also donât entirely close the door on low earth orbit satellite providers bidding in the low-latency tier.** However, it is also important to keep in mind the following point: The purpose of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is to ensure that Americans have access to broadband, no matter where they live. It is not a technology incubator to fund untested technologies. And we will not allow taxpayer funding to be wasted. A new technology may sound good in theory and look great on paper. But this multi-billion-dollar broadband program will require âtâs to be crossedânot fingers. So any such application will be given very close scrutiny.

2. [Commissioner Michael O'Rielly's statement](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/060962555534/DOC-364811A3.pdf):

    &gt; **I am grateful to the Chairman for agreeing to expand eligibility for the low-latency performance tier and change language that was prejudicial to certain providers.** While a technology neutral policy across the board may have been more effective in promoting innovation and maximizing the value of ratepayer investments, I recognize that a balancing act was necessary to reach the current disposition. I also thank the Chairman for agreeing to clarify that the Commission will re-evaluate the eligibility conditions prior to moving forward with the second phase of the auction. Communications technology evolves at an extremely rapid pace, and who knows which technologies will have advanced or emerged by the time we get to Phase II?

3. [Commissioner Geoffrey Starks's statement](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/060962555534/DOC-364811A6.pdf):

    &gt; The ten-year term the Commission chose in January has additional ramifications for this Public Notice. Committing so much of the budget for so long raises the stakes on how we treat emerging technologies and technical capabilities. **I appreciate Commissioner OâRiellyâs work in revising this Public Notice to eliminate the categorical bar on low earth orbit satellite systems bidding in the lowlatency tier, especially now that we have evidence in the record that those systems can meet the 100-millisecond latency standard.** At the same time, I see no need for the Public Noticeâs predictive judgments about the merits of short-form applications from low earth orbit satellite operators. As I have stated previously, **next-generation satellite broadband holds tremendous technological promise for addressing the digital divide and is led by strong American companies with a lengthy record of success.** Commission staff should evaluate those applications on their own merits.

4. Possible reason for FCC's change of mind, [found by u/softwaresaur](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/gzszn0/the_proposal_also_will_allow_low_earth_orbit/ftjjlh8/): [SpaceX held 3 day meeting with FCC on May 27/28/29](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/106012288627473/RDOF%20Ex%20Parte%20(6-1-2020\)%20(REDACTED\).pdf) to present [confidential test data that shows Starlink can indeed meet the low latency criteria](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10529094752788/SpaceX%20RDOF%20Ex%20Parte%20Confidentiality%20Request%20for%20Exhibit%20A%20(5-29-2020\).pdf):

    &gt; ...  on May 27, 28, and 29, 2020, ... SpaceX discussed [with the FCC] the draft Public Notice that would establish procedures for Auction 904. As demonstrated in Exhibit A, SpaceX explained that its system easily clears the Commissionâs 100 ms threshold for low-latency services, even including its âprocessing timeâ during unrealistic worst-case situations.

    &gt; Exhibit A, which is marked as âConfidential Information,â concerns SpaceXâs proprietary network latency testing information and internal performance data. This is company-specific, competitively-sensitive, business confidential and/or proprietary and commercial information concerning SpaceXâs operations that would not routinely be made available to the public, and has been carefully guarded from competitors. If it were disclosed, SpaceXâs potential competitors could use it to determine information regarding SpaceXâs competitive position, operations, and performance, and could use that information to gain a competitive advantage over SpaceX.

5. Some news articles, although they don't get into as much details:

* [FCC awarding up to $16 billion to address U.S. areas lacking broadband service](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-telecom-internet/fcc-awarding-up-to-16-billion-to-address-u-s-areas-lacking-broadband-service-idUSKBN23G29R?utm_source=reddit.com): This is already posted to this subreddit, but it's really vague.

* [FCC Clears Way for SpaceX to Vie for Rural Broadband Subsidies](https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/fcc-clears-way-for-spacex-to-vie-for-rural-broadband-subsidies): A better article that included some quotes from Pai and OâRielly



PS: FCC has 5 commissioners including the chairman, only 3 commissioners may be members of the same political party. Pai and O'Rielly are Republican and Starks is a Democrat, so it looks like this decision has bi-partisan support.",/r/spacex/comments/h04on0/fcc_just_voted_to_allow_starlink_to_bid_on_low/

#GPS Block III, Space Vehicle 3 (Columbus)

## Overview

GPS III are the third generation of the U.S. Space Force's NAVSTAR Global Positioning System satellites. The GPS III development contract was awarded to a team led by Lockheed Martin. Block III will improve position, navigation, and timing services for warfighter and civil users yielding superior system security, accuracy and reliability. When fully deployed, the GPS III constellation will feature a cross-linked command and control architecture, allowing the entire GPS constellation to be updated simultaneously from a single ground station. Additionally, a new spot beam capability for enhanced military (M-Code) coverage and increased resistance to hostile jamming will be incorporated. These enhancements will contribute to improved accuracy and assured availability for military and civilian users worldwide.

Lockheed Martin's flight-proven A2100 bus serves as the GPS III spacecraft platform. Unlike the GPS IIF satellite, the GPS III satellite features an apogee propulsion system. The satellite features a LEROS-1C engine as an apogee propulsion system as well as 2 deployable solar arrays to generate power. ITT, Clifton, N.J. provides the navigation payload, and General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Gilbert, Ariz., provides the Network Communications Element (NCE) which includes the UHF Crosslink and Tracking Telemetry &amp; Command (TT&amp;C) subsystems.

This mission launches the third GPS III satellite into orbit, and is the second GPS launch for SpaceX. Although the GPS III SV01 launch aboard Falcon 9 expended the booster, this mission's booster will be recovered via ASDS landing.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather, and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

spacex,"It's that time again! As per usual, we like to keep things as tight as possible. If you have content you created to share, whether that be images of the launch, videos, GIF's, etc, they go here.
# Photographer Contest
We decided to try out something new this time. 

 This time we are running a contest in this thread. You can submit your pictures related to this mission. That might be Falcon 9 on the launch pad, a launch picture or a streak shot of a starlink overfly. We will put this thread into contest mode and announce the winner when the droneship arrives back at Port Canaveral.

The winner will be allowed to post their picture directly on r/SpaceX and will get a special flair.

Rules:

- If no post reaches more than +10 votes , no winner will be selected
- You need to own the picture you are submitting
- 1 picture per person ( If you want to show more mark the one you are entering with #Contest)

If you have any feedback or ideas how to improve this contest, please send us a modmail!


## *As usual, our standard media thread rules apply:*

* **All top level comments must consist of an image, video, GIF, tweet or article.**
* If you're an amateur photographer, submit your content here. Professional photographers with subreddit accreditation can continue to submit to the front page, we also make exceptions for outstanding amateur content!
* Those in the aerospace industry (with subreddit accreditation) can likewise continue to post content on the front page.
* Mainstream media articles should be submitted here. Quality articles from dedicated spaceflight outlets *may* be submitted to the front page.
* **Direct all questions to the live launch thread.**",/r/spacex/comments/gw76k5/rspacex_starlink7_media_thread_photographer/

spacex,"Hello! It is u/RocketLover0119 hosting the recovery thread for core B1058.1 after successfully lofting S2 and Dragon to orbit with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley for the historic DM-2 mission, which returned american astronauts, on an american rocket, from american soil, back into orbit and to the ISS. Below is a table on the ships and their duties and status, as well as updates and resources.

## About DM-2

""On Saturday, May 30 at 3:22 p.m. EDT, SpaceXâs [Falcon 9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) launched [Crew Dragonâs second demonstration (Demo-2) mission](https://www.spacex.com/static/images/launches/Dem0-2_Artwork.png) from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASAâs Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the next day Crew Dragon autonomously docked to the International Space Station. This test flight with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board the [Dragon spacecraft](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/) returned human spaceflight to the United States.

Demo-2 is the final major test for SpaceXâs human spaceflight system to be certified by NASA for operational crew missions to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX is returning human spaceflight to the United States with one of the safest, most advanced systems ever built, and NASAâs Commercial Crew Program is a turning point for Americaâs future in space exploration that lays the groundwork for future missions to the [Moon](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/moon/), [Mars](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/), [and beyond](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/).""

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 7 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/hitura-nobad, your host for this mission.

#  Mission Overview

The eight Starlink launch overall and the seventh operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession) rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

spacex," This post is a compilation of Elon Musk and SpaceX presentation for Astro2020 regarding Starlink and Starship

[Jeff Foust on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/jeff_foust/status/1254818901944344576?s=20)

""Elon  Musk is giving a presentation at a public meeting of an Astro2020  astrophysics decadal survey cmte meeting on efforts to mitigate  brightness of Starlink satellites. First âVisorSatâ satellites, with  sunshade to block reflections off antennas, planned to be on next  launch. ""

""Musk also says that  SpaceX is implementing an âorientation rollâ on those satellites whose  orbits are being raised to reduce reflections off solar panels.""

""Musk  estimates the existing Starlink satellites, including those without any  brightness mitigations, will be deorbited in 3-4 years, in part because  theyâll be rendered obsolete by v2 satellites with  âfar greater  throughput.â""

""Musk says darkening the satellites is âquite simple, actuallyâ and that âweâll feel a bit silly in hindsight.â""

""Musk:  think 550 km altitude is the right approach for LEO broadband  constellations, but donât know if there will be a lot of other systems.  âThe big challenge is not going bankrupt.â ""

""Musk  says heâs âpretty interestedâ to talk with astronomy community on ways  to launch or even build a large space telescope, âmaybe a planet imager  or something like this.â""

""Musk  briefly mentions Starship launch system, says that âweâll see regular  flights, I think, within a couple years.â Notes that it could play a  role in launching space based telescopes. ""

["".@elonmusk:  The goal of @SpaceX is to make Starlink satellites ""invisible to the  naked eye within a week of launch"".

[.@elonmusk  What the public sees is mostly the #Starlink objects during orbit  raise. Once the objects reach station, the source of brightness is the  reflection from antennas. We tried blacking out the antennas on Darksat  and it worked, but sun shades will work better. #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254817746224742405?s=20)

[I  will say that this presentation by @elonmusk for #Astro2020 includes  the most detailed view of the Starlink satellites I have yet seen. He's  reiterating the point about the goal of Starlink to not yield an impact  to science.](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254818492177514508?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  : We're interested in replacing the earliest Starlink sats we launched  as the tech progresses. We expect the 1st generation sats to be replaced  on a timescale of 3-4 years. We do not want 'ancient electronics' in  orbit like GEO sats up there for 15, 20 years. #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254821665264959498?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  , in response to a question from the #Astro2020 WG: We support a  regulatory framework that requires satellite operators to keep object  brightness ""within limits that donât fundamentally inhibit science.""  #Starlink](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254819504518922253?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  reiterates: ""If thereâs any situation where weâre impeding science, we  will take corrective action."" #Starlink #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254822241465860097?s=20)

[As  an aside, @elonmusk mentioned the large diameter of the Starship faring  and its ability to launch ""quite a big thing"" in it, referring to a  question about using SpaceX hardware to launch telescopes and similar  missions into space. #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254822814592335876?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  : The benefit of hindsight suggests that satellite visibility  mitigation efforts are quite simple; reduce albedo of surfaces or shade  them. ""It's not that hard."" #Starlink #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254824391621238784?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  : ""The big challenge for LEO constellations is not going bankrupt. This  is quite hard. I wouldnât say weâre out of the woods in this regard.â  Wouldnât expect to see a large number of LEO constellations. Hopes for  just one (presumably his). #Starlink #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254824707787911168?s=20)

[Patricia  Cooper (@SpaceX) briefly discusses RFI even though it's outside the  scope of this meeting.

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 6 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shahar603, your host for this mission.

#  Mission Overview

The seventh Starlink launch overall and the sixth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession) rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

spacex,"[Elon gets into it with Eric Berger and twitterverse](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1250612062989905921), here's highlights: -

Eric Berger: ""SpaceX is surely saving money on launches, and if the Falcon 9 weren't already insanely cheaper than everyone else, the company could cut prices substantially.""

**Elon:** ""True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, theyâd be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.""

Eric Berger: ""Maybe check Block 5âs record [on reliability].""

**Elon:** ""Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. Thatâs the acid test.""

Michael Sheetz: ""How much less?""

**Elon:** ""Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only [American] rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.""

Everyday Astronaut: ""Atlas V is an American rocket (well minus the engines ;)""

**Elon:** ""Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.""

~~[CProphet sidenote: believe Airbus manufacture Atlas V airframe]~~ 

**Elon:** ""Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch""

**Elon:** ""Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. Itâs a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!""

Tobi Li: ""What Is the latest SN number for the raptor engine?""

**Elon:** ""SN26""

Sivakumar Kumar: ""What do you think about @RocketLabâs latest retrieval effort?""

**Elon:** ""Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesnât scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, itâs probably right move for small LEO vehicle.""

**Elon:** ""I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! Itâs very hard. Iâm spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done :)""

Everyday Astronaut: ""Itâs insane how quick SN4 is coming together. It makes sense when you build a factory AROUND your rockets (not vice versa), cool to see mass manufacturing taking an early lead in development vs one off prototyping. I hope when itâs closer to done I can get a tour from you ;)""

**Elon:** ""Production is by *far* the hard part. Thatâs why Iâm not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, theyâre pretty sweet â¦""

Everyday Astronaut: ""Itâd be so cool to do a tour of Hawthorne vs Boca Chica and see the differences in philosophies between early SpaceX vs current. Boca Chica is just a giant playground / test bed, which is cool!""

**Elon:** ""Sure""

Keith Mansfield: ""Everything crossed for SN4. This time!""

**Elon:** ""Thatâs for sure! [Smiling face with open mouth and cold sweat]""

Michael Baylor: ""Will SN4 hop to 20 km or just 150 m if the pressure tests and static fire goes well?""

**Elon:** ""SN4 wonât get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.""

Analysis: Elon sounds stressed, which is understandable. Only a couple of days until SN4 pressure test - and its already made redundant by SN5/6.

#Starlink-6 (STARLINK V1.0-L6)

We are looking for launch thread hosts. If you are interested in hosting please send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fspacex).

## Overview

The seventh Starlink launch overall and the sixth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

## About The Recovery

SpaceX is going to conclude the CRS-20 Cargo Dragon mission to the International Space Station on April 7th with the deorbit and recovery of this spacecraft. Dragon will splash down in the Pacific Ocean approximately 815 km southwest of  Los Angeles. The west coast dragon recovery ship NRC Quest will be waiting at the landing zone to pick dragon up and bring it back to the harbour.

spacex,"*SpaceX has provided the following statement from CONAE, translated to English, regarding the postponement of the SAOCOM 1B mission:*

**The launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite is postponed**
 
The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation and the National Commission for Space Activities (CONAE) announce the decision to postpone the launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite, originally scheduled for the end of March.
 
This decision has been made considering the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and that could affect the availability of own resources and foreign third-party resources, necessary not only for a safe insertion into orbit, but also for further operation of the satellite.
 
This postponement has been agreed with the company providing the launch service, SpaceX, considering that it is the best decision in these moments of uncertainty and dynamism about the situation that the whole world suffers because of COVID-19.
 
This measure will be supplemented with activities at the launch base that will ensure the conditions for adequate protection of the SAOCOM 1B satellite at the SpaceX facilities.
 
The authorities of this Commission will await the evolution of the conditions that will make possible the resume of the activities related to the launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite and its subsequent reliable injection into its final orbit according to the original plans.",/r/spacex/comments/foav19/statement_from_conae_regarding_the_postponement/

spacex,"Hello! it is u/RocketLover0119 back at it hosting the recovery thread for the launch of the 5th batch of operational Starlink satellites! Below is info on the mission, info on the core/fairing, updates, and more!

## About Starlink

"" SpaceX is leveraging its experience in building rockets and spacecraft to deploy the world's most advanced broadband internet system. With performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet and a global network unbounded by ground infrastructure limitations, Starlink will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable. Each Starlink satellite weights approximately 260 kg and features a compact, flat-panel design that minimizes volume, allowing for a dense launch stack to take full advantage of Falcon 9âs launch capabilities. With four powerful phased array and two parabolic antennas on each satellite, an enormous amount of throughput can be placed and redirected in a short time, for an order of magnitude lower cost than traditional satellite-based internet. Starlink satellites are on the leading edge of on-orbit debris mitigation, meeting or exceeding all regulatory and industry standards. At end of their life cycle, the satellites will utilize their on-board propulsion system to deorbit over the course of a few months. In the unlikely event their propulsion system becomes inoperable, the satellites will burn up in Earthâs atmosphere within 1-5 years, significantly less than the hundreds or thousands of years required at higher altitudes. Further, Starlink components are designed for full demisability. Starlink is targeting service in the Northern U.S. and Canada in 2020, rapidly expanding to near global coverage of the populated world by 2021. Additional information on the system can be found at starlink.com. ""

## Core B1048.5

The core utilized in this mission is core 48. This core completed a historic first for SpaceX, which is launching and landing a core for the 5th time. Previously, this core flew on the Iridium-7, SAOCOM-1A, Nusantara Satu, and the 2nd launch of Starlink missions. Unfortunately, during this mission core 48 failed to land. According to Musk, an engine turned off (some speculate an engine went boom, similar to CRS-1). The core had a good ascent until the anomaly, separated stages, deployed fins, and completed what appears to have been a 2 engine entry burn (speculation). Beyond that, it seems it didn't even light for landing, and smashed into the ocean at terminal speed. RIP B1048.

## Fairing

In this mission, the fairings are flight-proven. These 2 halves both previously supported the first launch of Starlink in May of last year, with these halves being fished from the sea by GO Navigator and GO Searcher. This is only the second time SpaceX has utilized previously flown fairings, with high hopes of continuing to recover and reuse other halves. The 2 halves were not caught, but were, however, retrieved from the ocean by Ms. tree and Ms. Chief.

spacex,"It's that time again, as per usual, we like to keep things as tight as possible, so if you have content you created to share, whether that be images of the launch, videos, GIF's, etc, they go here.

As usual, our standard media thread rules apply:

All top level comments must consist of an image, video, GIF, tweet or article. If you're an amateur photographer, submit your content here. Professional photographers with subreddit accreditation can continue to submit to the front page, we also make exceptions for outstanding amateur content! Those in the aerospace industry (with subreddit accreditation) can likewise continue to post content on the front page. Mainstream media articles should be submitted here. Quality articles from dedicated spaceflight outlets may be submitted to the front page.

As usual, our standard media thread rules apply:

All top level comments must consist of an image, video, GIF, tweet or article. If you're an amateur photographer, submit your content here. Professional photographers with subreddit accreditation can continue to submit to the front page, we also make exceptions for outstanding amateur content! Those in the aerospace industry (with subreddit accreditation) can likewise continue to post content on the front page. Mainstream media articles should be submitted here. Quality articles from dedicated spaceflight outlets may be submitted to the front page.

spacex,"Hey everyone,

I want to introduce my new Twitter bot to you:

#### [ The Starlink Deployment Update Bot](https://twitter.com/StarlinkUpdates)

### What can it do?
It is posting updated graphs of the Starlink satellite attitude for each launch once a day on twitter.

### How does it work?
#### Part 1: The Scrapper
It uses wget to download https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/supplemental/starlink.txt three times a day, 1 hour after the update is released by SpaceX, and saves it onto my Server.
#### Part 2: Calculator
The next script loads the TLEs and calculates different orbit heights from them.
#### Part 3: Separator
The following script splits the TLEs after the different missions and appends to the archive of previously calculated data points for the specific launch.
#### Part 4: Generator/Plotter
The plotter uses Matplotlib to generated an updated graph from the given data and saves it as png.
#### Part 5: Poster
The last script uploads the png to twitter and posts the thread once a day.

### Future Expansions
- Possibility to highlight specific sats
- Loading additional data from the r/SpaceX API
- Plotting other interesting values than just orbital height

### Thanks
- u/thevehicledestroyer for helping to debug my TLE generation code making it more accurate
- Dr. T.S. Kelso for providing me the exact times when SpaceX publishes new TLEs",/r/spacex/comments/exrmyu/introducing_the_starlink_deployment_update_bot/

spacex,"Welcome to another r/SpaceX meta thread, where we talk about how the sub is running and the stuff going on behind the scenes, and where everyone can offer input on things they think are good, bad or anything in between.

Our [last meta thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/cbrhk0/july_2019_meta_thread_new_mods_new_bots/) went pretty well, so weâre sticking with the new format going forward.

In short, we're leaving this as a stub and writing up a handful of topics as top level comments to get the ball rolling. Of course, we invite you to start comment threads of your own to discuss any other subjects of interest as well.

As usual, you can ask or say anything in freely in this thread. We will only remove abusive spam and bigotry.

spacex,"## Overview[](https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1104014992347607042/photo/1)
 
This mission is a test of Crew Dragon's abort capability as part of NASA'a Commercial Crew Integrated Capability program (CCiCap). SpaceX will launch a Crew Dragon capsule from LC-39A, Kennedy Space Center on a fully fueled Falcon 9 rocket and then trigger the launch escape system during the period of maximum dynamic pressure. The abort sequence terminates launcher thrust, separates Dragon and trunk from the second stage, and ignites the eight SuperDraco engines which pull the capsule away from the launch vehicle. Following shutdown of the SuperDracos Dragon coasts to apogee, separates from the trunk, and lands in the Atlantic Ocean under parachutes. Crew Dragon will be recovered by GO Searcher after splashdown approximately 30 km from the launch site. This flight does not go to orbit.

Falcon 9 core 1046.4 flies in expendable configuration, without legs, grid fins, or TEA-TEB engine ignition fluid. Since the abort sequence will be initiated before staging, the second stage has not been equipped with an Mvac engine or the associated hardware, but is expected to be fueled. Falcon 9 will likely break apart due to aerodynamic loads immediately following Crew Dragon's escape.

The abort test occurs approximately 80-100 seconds into flight. Breakup of Falcon 9 is expected within seconds thereafter. Splashdown of the capsule will occur within a few minutes following abort.

##Mission-Specific FAQ

###Will the flight termination system be used?

From the [Environmental Assessment](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/environmental/nepa_docs/review/launch/media/Final_EA_and_FONSI_for_SpaceX_In-flight_Dragon_Abort_508_A.pdf 'FAA.gov (PDF)') it does not appear that the autonomous flight termination system will be used. The abort sequence will be triggered by a ""simulated loss of thrust"" (rather than a disintegrating rocket). The booster is expected to become uncontrollable after Dragon separation and break apart from the intense aerodynamic forces within seconds. A conflagration is possible, but not certain.

###Is there a chance the booster will land, and what is the downrange launch hazard area for?

The Environmental Assessment explicitly states that no landing attempt (or landing gear) will be a part of this mission. Although environmental assessments often contain outdated information, this is also supported by the lack of the usual booster recovery communications permit. The downrange [launch hazard area](https://twitter.com/raul74cz/status/1212197735820083200 'Twitter, @Raul74Cz') appears to represent the improbable scenario in which the abort system fails to terminate thrust. Falcon 9 or its post reentry debris would fall in this hazard area.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if changes or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

JCSAT-18 is a mobile broadband communications payload built for Sky Perfect JSAT Corporation of Japan and will service Asia Pacific. Kacific1 is a high throughput broadband internet payload built for Kacific Broadband Satellites and will service certain high demand areas of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Both payloads share a single chassis.

SpaceX will launch the Boeing built dual payload satellite to geostationary transfer orbit from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral AFS on a Falcon 9, and the first-stage booster is expected to land downrange on the OCISLY droneship.

This is SpaceX's **13th** mission of 2019, its **6th** commercial flight of the year and the **77th** Falcon 9 launch overall. It will re-use the FT Block 5 booster flown on NASA CRS-17 and CRS-18.

## Mission-Specific FAQ

### Why is this mission landing on the droneship downrange, rather than back at Cape Canaveral?

Boosting satellites into geostationary transfer orbit takes a lot more energy/delta-V (i.e. propellant) than just into low earth orbit, given the apogee of the former is 35 786 km as opposed to 200-2000 km for the latter. This requires the Falcon 9 second stage to perform a substantial extra to inject the satellite into this orbit from LEO, which requires that sufficient propellant be left over from insertion into the initial LEO parking orbit. This in turn requires the first stage to do more of the work accelerating the second stage to orbital velocity, meaning that it in turn is both traveling at a higher speed at separation and is further downrange from the Cape, while having less propellant remaining.

Therefore, with less propellant available and more required to boost back, landing on the droneship allows the booster to efficiently use its remaining propellant margin to perform an entry burn, reducing re-entry heating, and leaving it enough margin for the landing burn. 


### How come this mission is landing if its heavier than the 5500 kg reusable GTO limit?

The payload will be delivered into a subsynchronous GTO, with an apogee lower than the standard 35 786 km, which naturally takes less propellant from the second stage to raise its orbit to. Therefore, the second stage can in turn do more of the work injecting into a parking orbit, allowing the first stage enough propellant margin to land. While this results in a somewhat longer time for the satellite to come into service, and requires a larger propellant tank for its kick motor, the customer evidently decided the substantially cheaper launch cost vs. an expendable or Falcon Heavy launch was worth these relatively modest downsides. This has been done on several prior missions, such as Telstar 18V and 19V.

Check out the [Watching a Launch page](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/faq/watching) on this sub's FAQ, which gives a summary of every viewing site and answers many more common questions, as well as [Ben Cooper's launch viewing guide](http://www.launchphotography.com/Delta_4_Atlas_5_Falcon_9_Launch_Viewing.html), [Launch Rats](https://launchrats.com/), and the [Space Coast Launch Ambassadors](https://scla.space) which have interactive maps, photos and detailed information about each site.


### I want the best view of the launch. Where should I go?

The KSCVC LC-39 gantry is indisputably the best option (cost aside) and an incredible experience, but is now sold out. The KSCVC Saturn V Center is second best, and is first come, first serve so get there early (before 9 am recommended)! Playalinda beach is the closest low-cost option by a considerable margin, though the view of the pad is obstructed by dunes and scrub, while Titusville and Port Canaveral are further but free/low cost. There are a number of additional options further away; check out the information on our [Watching a Launch FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/faq/watching) (courtesy Julia Bergeron and the SLCA) for more.


### I'd like the closest possible view of this launch's booster landing. What's my best option?

Unfortunately, since the landing will be far downrange, you'll be lucky to even catch a glimpse of the entry burn (which is possible, though far from guaranteed, anywhere you have a clear shot to the eastern horizon). Other than that, this isn't possible, sorry, so you should optimize for launch accordingly.

We plan to keep this post regularly updated with the latest information, FAQs and resources, so please ping us under the thread below if you'd like us to add or modify something. This thread is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards liftoff. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

**Campaign threads are not launch threads; normal subreddit rules still apply.**",/r/spacex/comments/e5w3n3/jcsat18kacific1_launch_campaign_thread/

spacex,"SN5 and SN6 were built together I believe.  SN5 is on the pad now (July 22).  SN6 is not completed and is likely to be scrapped because they developed a new metal alloy and changed their welding techniques for the next model which is SN7.

SN7 was a prototype tank version using new metal and welding techniques that was built to blow up.  They tested it to destruction (kept increasing the pressure until it blew up).

SN8 is the full version Starship with the new metal and welding.

So the plan appears to be to Fly SN5 150 Meters and then skip SN6 so they can go right to testing the new metal alloy version (SN8).

SN5's Raptor engine is placed off center and will need to tilt and aim slightly sideways or the vehicle will start spinning.

Since the flamy side going down is slightly sideways, in order to be sure the pointy side is up, the whole vehicle will tilt slightly sideways.

However, it may be so slight you won't even notice.

spacex,"They are still working out how to build this.  Fully automating a poorly designed, inefficient, or unneeded process or part is generally a mistake; and it can be expensive lesson to try and replace people on tasks they are (currently) better at.  Even if they get to 2 Starships a week coming off the line, there will likely be steps that don't make sense to automate (as the development and testing effort won't pay for itself).

*\*although it is still important to know you ultimately want to automate it, and possibly mass produce a part, as that plays into the design, material, and process choices.*

That said, partial-automation even at this point can be beneficial.  There are steps that are well enough known that they can increase quality and consistency, and free up the crew to focus on other activities.  Barrels are stacked up quickly due to machine welding, and other parts like the bulkheads would see similar returns.  And even if these processes need to be tweaked, there likely won't be a huge retooling cost.  But fully automating placing and welding on flight components seems premature.

u/Martianspirit pointed out that the Model 3 was a hard lesson in over automation being a costly mistake; but it was also an example of unneeded complexity in product design resulting in an excessive numbers of production steps and a huge amount of money wasted automating that.  Fortunately between Giga Shanghai ramp up they've learned about simplifying production, and with the Model Y design simplifying parts; they are definitely learning lessons \[while still trying to push some innovations into production, at the appropriate time - ie, machine installable wiring conduits which might come in the future, but not yet\]",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fywkc2a/

They seem to have done extensive testing of Raptor, and have proof of concept of how to approach these problems from their experiences with Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9.

I wouldn't want to say these problems are ""easy to solve"" or anything, but the hardest part seems to be having a methodology to approach the problem, and experience with it, and they appear to have that in spades. Meanwhile, they also have no other large distractions to throw the company off course, like we've seen for the past few years.

Hopefully Endeavor lands and validates their crew program, and the next crewed mission goes up without any hitches that move elements of their R&amp;D back onto problems that already seem solved, and do not contribute to Starship development.",/r/spacex/comments/hvbja9/elon_musk_will_attempt_to_fly_later_this_week/fywc20z/

&gt; quoted text In 2011, Musk estimated that fuel and oxidizer for the Falcon 9 v1.0 rocket cost a total of about $200,000.[156] The first stage uses 245,620 L (64,885 US gal) of liquid oxygen and 146,020 L (38,575 US gal) of RP-1 fuel,[157] while the second stage uses 28,000 L (7,300 US gal) of liquid oxygen and 17,000 L (4,600 US gal) of RP-1.

spacex,"For me, it really depends on the time of day, which launch pad will be used and what my goals are for the photos I hope to take away from that particular mission. For this one, I had one DSLR set for a wide shot, which was cropped to become the image you see here, while another DSLR was placed further back with a telephoto to capture an engine shot with more detail ([which you can view here](https://adambernsteinphotography.smugmug.com/Gallery/SpaceX-Falcon-9-ANASIS-II/)). 

While I love detailed engine/exhaust shots, I find there are fewer opportunities to frame the shot using visible elements and structures around the pad - which I prefer. It really comes down to personal preference. As far as combining the two elements, I prefer to work with what comes out of the camera rather than layer different exposures as a âsingle shot.â Itâs more challenging to do so and always teaches me more about the process, making for a more valuable learning experience.",/r/spacex/comments/hv9m6x/remotes_are_back_from_the_pad_bringing_a_much/fyvke7u/

spacex,"I know the Saturn V 1st &amp; 2nd stages behaved that way, so it has some merit for that concept.

In the case of the Merlin engine, there are only two variants to simplify the manufacturing process: the lower stage engines and the vacuum engine for the upper stage.  Even then the only difference is the engine bell size and the mechanical links for gimbal movement.

This is important because Elon Musk wanted to treat rocket engine manufacturing like building automobiles and get similar benefits from reliability and cost.  This is a big deal when compared to most other rocket engines are ""hand crafted"" and have production numbers of just a few per year.  The Merlin engine at one point in time had as many as one engine being produced every day or more.

Some of that is giving way to Raptor engine production, which is going to have an even higher production rate eventually.  Still, if you think about it the most expensive part of any manufacturing process is tool set up and establishing logistical supplies to make the products.  This production line is really the unsung accomplishment of SpaceX that really makes the difference between them and other companies.  Many in the aerospace industry even thought it was a waste of money and even some were critical of SpaceX using the same basic engine for the upper stage as well.

3 engine takeoff will require larger dummy load on top, possibly steel cube and one of the nose cones. But i doubt SN8 is going to progress from 150m hop to 20km belly flops, too many untested processes there. Ideally belly flop happens after the regular flight algorithms have been tested.

SN7 probably has to happen between SN5 and 6 though as its pathfinder for new alloys, used in SN8 (presumably).",/r/spacex/comments/hvbja9/elon_musk_will_attempt_to_fly_later_this_week/fyuylej/

spacex,"&gt;I'm hoping they added some control surfaces or something so they are literally flying them back down.

Yeah, imagine they're skydivers the size of greyhound busses. The parachutes are ram-air canopies, and can be steered (and, to an extent, slowed down) by pulling on control lines. Skydivers can consistently hit targets the size of a dinner plate with chutes like this. There's a little complication with the fairings because they want them to land straight down on the net instead of sliding to a stop.

So, I theorize that the boat and the fairing are negotiating an agreement. The boat announces that it will be traveling at a specific direction (i.e. into the wind) at a specific speed (i.e. a little greater than the fairing's minimum speed, accounting for wind speed). The fairing in turn announces when and where it would like the boat to be cruising at that heading and speed. Then the fairing gives adjusted target speeds and headings to the boat as it gets closer to the water, compensating for unknown winds at altitude. They should be in constant communication, sending their GPS locations and speeds back and forth. Ideally a highly spiffed up autopilot runs the boat's throttle and helm for this process.

Of course, there has to be an initial best guess of where the boat should start, based on the launch profile, so it has a chance of ""getting to the church on time"" after getting the first position report from the fairing.

This would be a fun thing to write the code for. At least as challenging as landing the first stage, since that trick only involves one moving vehicle.",/r/spacex/comments/huv6hu/elonmusk_on_twitter_both_fairing_halves_caught/fythmgi/

If I was them and I had billions to spend, I'd create such a large second stage that it wouldn't need fairings but instead would fly back for complete reuse.

Lunar Starship (maybe)

But aside from that, SN5 and SN6 are almost identical, so successful tests of SN5 will remove any need to test SN6; that design is now obsolete. SN8 is being made from a new alloy using different welding methods (the same as they used for the SN7 test tank) and likely has many more improvements that are less clearly visible.

Basically what it boils down to is that SN6 tests are likely to be a waste of time; that time would be better spent testing the *current* system, as present in SN8, even if some of it has to be used putting SN8 together (which would need to be done anyway).

In this case, the parachute seems unable to counteract changing wind direction during descent.  A remedy might be a slightly smaller parachute with a faster forward speed and descent rate.

I know there is a time limit there too for deployment and operations.  SpaceX even objected to the time limit (imposed due to lobbying by OneWeb), but it was agreed upon as well.

Waiting an extra year for serving that part of the world shouldn't be more than an inconvenience, but my point is that people living in Barrow, Alaska don't need to simply hope they eventually seem like a good idea.

However, with SpaceX having a proven/reliable launch system already in place, a habit of being less expensive that competitors, no shared architecture with the other suppliers and a record of adapting their architectures to the customer's requirements, this all makes them seem to be in with a good chance for one of the two awards.

If you're launching satellites to orbit the window is pretty flexible, why launch 2 at the same time when you can have 2 launches within a few days? There's also not a situation in which they would have to launch more than 4 astronauts to the ISS at the same time, hypothetically if they needed to put 4+ astronauts to the ISS the crew dragon is capable of up to 7, the ISS has a capacity of 6.

Article specifically references an Elon tweet dated May 30 2019   question was asked 

""Ah, so single-stage point-to-point? That sounds way better""

Elon Response:

""Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20.""

Also in some of his more recent tweets ( couldn't find quickly at the moment)  Elon has discussed special SS variants for E2E  with more engines to improve TWR and lower gravity losses for sub orbital E2E flights.

Edit:
 
Further down in same teslarati article:

Q: ""I guess the whole SSTO idea doesn't work because of lift off thrust. Raptor is powerful, but with a full propellant load Starship has a TWR under 1. It would need two more engines to have any shot at it.

Starship thrust is appropriately scaled for what it's supposed to do.""

Naturally. While there is mostly SpaceX with low offers, the trend is still that all the expensive launches go to ULA. They got a whole bunch of very expensive Delta IV Heavy launches which SpaceX FH could have done  for a fraction of the cost. Reason being that if ULA does not get those contracts they close the production line for Delta.

My impression is still, SpaceX gets all the praise, ULA gets all the juicy contracts. Until this changes launch prices on average remain high. We will see if SpaceX gets the 60% contract which they should get. They are the only ones who have a certified launch fleet and they are cheaper.

* Webcast: 26674 km/h 164 km  
* Convert Webcast *ground speed* to m/s and to orbital speed (add 460): 7869.4 m/s  
* *Assume* we are at periapsis  
* Semi-axis is (Rpe + Rap)/2 (average of the radius at Pe and Ap)

* I get 382 km

To sanity check that result, let's use [a random point before SES-2](https://youtu.be/TshvZlQ7le8?t=2464)  
  
*  Webcast: 26601 km/h 181 km

* How to intuitively understand orbits: Buy Kerbal Space Program, watch Scott Manley videos  
* Orbital theory: Read the wikipedia page on [orbit mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics) and [orbital elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_elements). Only consider Periapsis, Apoapsis and inclination as the others elements are irrelevant for energy calculations  
* How to compute an orbit based on speed and altitude at Apoapsis or Periapsis: Solve the [vis-visa equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics#Velocity) at the known position (Ap or Pe), the semi major axis contains the unknown (Ap/Pe Altitude). A reddit user made [this spreadsheet ^expires ^01/09/20](https://gofile.io/d/SckbGV) to compute GTO-xxxx values, but if you just play with each lines (See how E, F and G column change M and P columns), you will be able to see how it's done. I pre-filed it the published orbit for this launch.  
* How to guesstimate the orbit from webcast telemetry: Use the above and make assumptions such as SES-2 happening at roughly the final GTO orbit Pe altitude, speed being relative to surface (add earth rotational speed), SpaceX not fudging the numbers too much....  
* How to compute the GTO-xxxx value. Use the above on each of the burn points needed to reach GEO. For each, split speed in normal and tangential, add the burn components (normal and tangential) to get the new speed. The target orbit (GEO) is 35786 x 35786 x 0Â°.

spacex,"The re-entry burn always uses three engines, so does the boost back burn. However during these two burns, they ignite the centre engine first to stabilise the rocket, and then ignite two other engines, which due to the increased acceleration, reduces gravity losses. At the end of the burn the two outer engines shut down, and the centre engine ceeps running for a bit. This allows the trajectory to be fine tuned, and the orientation of the vehicle to be corrected, in case the outer engines do not shit down at exactly the same time. 
Droneship landings are usually also performed this way. One engine ignites, which ads a lot of control and stability, followed by the ignition of two more engines, which reduces gravity losses. The final landing is performed with only one engine, since it is easier to land with a lower thrust, since there is more time for corrections.
Land landings usually have higher margins (this is also the reason why they can afford the boost back burn), so a three engine landing burn isn't umdone very often.

spacex,"No. It was explained in the broadcast that, for GTO launches, launching at the beginning of the window allows a reset to launch at the very end of the countdown, by emptying the tanks and starting a new load-and-go cycle. GTO launches are the only ones that allow such a wide margin in the launch time.

I wrote a post just a day or 2 ago, detailing the burns involved in getting from the surface of the Earth to GTO, and then from GTO to GEO.  It shows that launches to GTO/GEO are about the least sensitive when it comes to the time of launch.

But most of the cost is the fact that they are very large (you can park a bus inside), need to withstand a lot of pressure at MaxQ without buckling, so need to be quite stiff, and also need to be as light as possible.

spacex,"The other answers missed some important points, so, ...

1. After separation, Elon has described each fairing half as, ""its own little spacecraft."" It has thrusters, gyros and enough guidance computer power to keep the outer portion of the fairing oriented into the wind, to provide the slight heat shielding needed, to slow the descent, and to prevent the fairing braking up when aerodynamic forces become significant.
2. Once aerodynamic forces become significant, it becomes possible to use the cold gas thrusters to steer the fairing halves toward the recovery ships. Looking at the shape of the fairings, my guess is that the L/D is higher than that of say, a Dragon capsule. My guess is that each fairing can steer 10 or 20 km while high in the atmosphere.
3. As the fairing gets lower, and slower, steering using the cold gas thrusters gradually stops working. At this point, a drogue chute must be deployed, followed by the parafoil. Parafoils are steerable, (by pulling on control strings) but they are so slow that jet stream winds are up to 20 times faster, so a successful catch is at the mercy of these winds, and accurate weather forecasts. Releasing high altitude weather balloons from the catch vessels might be the latest improvement.
4.  At low altitudes, winds are less, so control authority of the parafoil becomes greater. calm breezes and seas increase the odds of a successful catch.",/r/spacex/comments/huv6hu/elonmusk_on_twitter_both_fairing_halves_caught/fyqj684/

I am saving that.
Thanks.

Partly this is an engineering problem, partly this is just that the hydrolox exhaust is much, much lighter. This is great from an Isp standpoint because it leads to higher exhaust velocities and higher efficiency. But it's terrible for generating high thrust.

Some examples. Look at the space shuttle main engine (SSME, RS-25). One of the most expensive and advanced engines ever created. A full-flow staged combustion, regeneratively cooled LOX/LH2 engine. Each one generated about 2.3 MegaNewtons of thrust, with a sealevel exhaust velocity of 3.56 km/s, all from a beast of an engine that weighed 3.2 tonnes each. If you do the math, that thrust and exhaust velocity works out to a mass flow rate of 640 kg/s.

Now, compare that to a Merlin 1-D LOX/Kerosene engine. A gas-generator ""open cycle"" engine very similar in design to rocket engines built in the 1960s. Iteratively upgraded a lot to maximize performance, but still fundamentally limited in a few ways (it doesn't use staged combustion, for example). A sealevel exhaust velocity of just 2.75 km/s, just 77% of what the SSME was able to achieve. However, each engine weighs only 490 kg, and can pump out 845 kN of thrust. If you do the math, that's a mass flow rate of 306 kg/s, in an engine about 1/6th the mass of the SSME. With 6 Merlin 1-D's you can produce over twice the thrust of a single SSME for less total engine mass.

Some of this comes back to basic gas laws. Lower molecular weight exhaust leads to higher molecular speeds at equivalent temperatures, but it also leads to lower mass flow at equivalent pressures. But a lot of it comes down to propellant density. Go back to the SSME vs. Merlin 1-D's again. 6x Merlin 1-D's move 1800 liters/s of propellant, while 1x SSME moves 1900 liters/s of propellant, and they have equivalent engine weights, but the 6x Merlin 1-D's produce over twice as much total thrust.

Even if you scale things back to just 3x Merlin 1-D's where you have roughly equivalent rates of LOX usage you end up with the Merlin 1-D's pumping about 320 liters/s or 255 kg/s of Kerosene while the SSME is pumping a whopping 1280 liter/s of hydrogen but that's still only 91 kg/s. And the end result is that the 3x Merlin 1-D's produce more thrust with less than half the total engine mass of the SSME.

With Hydrogen you need big pipes and big turbopumps and that translates to heavier engines for the same thrust.",/r/spacex/comments/hu6sci/rspacex_anasisii_official_launch_discussion/fypvfov/

Honestly the biggest limiter of dual launches is actual launch facilities in close proximity, and little need at this point for the capability. 

That is part of the reason why SpaceX is creating the SS/SH combo.

spacex,"&gt;Does/Will SpaceX have the operational capacity to handle same-day launches?

Right now spacex does not have the capacity for same day launches but the starship super heavy system including GSE is being designed with this in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What launch sites would be the most feasible for same-day launches? 

None of their existing sites would really be a good fit for multiple same day launches although this is really not a hardware problem but rather a range availability problem. Range control for more frequent launches was one of the original reasons listed for the development of the boca chica site back when it was intended to launch F9 and FH.   For high flight rates  spacex is investigating the use of ""floating launch complexes""  basically large platforms out at sea to launch and land rockets from in a safe environment where noise is much less of a concern.  They have already begun hiring engineers for this initiative.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Will boosters possibly be re-used for same-day launches? 

The intent is that yes the same booster is designed to be fly almost hourly if capacity dictates ( take this with a grain of salt,  F9 block 5 was supposed to be designed to re fly with a 24 hour turn around time and we are still a long way from that).  Note while the booster can RTLS within 15 minutes of launch the upper stage takes several hours due to orbital dynamics so the stated elon goal is that starships can fly up to three times a day ( again take this with a grain of salt)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Would this be the norm for orbital refueling? 

Yes the refueling will likely be the primary driver of higher flight rates early in the life cycle of Starship / Super Heavy.  It may take 7 or more tanker flights to top up a starship so high flight numbers are required.  This will be interesting to see as they will need it for their artemis program ""lunar starship""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What types of missions would benefit from multiple same-day launches? 

Refueling will definitely benefit from same day launches,  there is also the stated goal of earth to earth flight/transport using only starship,  this will likely start as an ultra high speed intercontinental delivery service and extend to passenger travel once / if sufficient safety levels are attained. This question is also a bit unknown at this point in addition to Refueling missions,  and E2E transport there is a bit of a ""If you build it they will come"" flavor to this system as well.  I don't think there is really a good understanding of what the need will be for a high capacity spaceflight at orders of magnitude below today's cost.   You could see daily or weekly trips to ISS,  you could see an explosion of commercial activity / space tourism.

Is it 3 for the re-entry burn and only 1 for landing?

The return-to-launch-site landing confused me for a long time because if you go up, then east, then west, then down... the down part is free obviously but you need to spend fuel to slow down and land gently. But to go west again you need to slow down then go back the way you came which sounds like an INSANE waste of fuel... until you remember by this point the rocket has shed almost all of its weight, in particular the second stage and payload plus most of its fuel. 
So a lighter rocket can go west again for a fraction of the fuel.

So is it 1-3-1 to slow to a stop, turn around and head west again, then it's only a single rocket for landing?",/r/spacex/comments/hmlcar/rspacex_discusses_july_2020_70/fypj5s7/

Then do all the scene-referred edits and the final output conversion on the merged stack as a single image(ideally in floating point to preserve the range).

HDR photography isn't always done this way, sometimes it's manually compositing over several separate images, but that can lose data since you have multiple clip/rolloff points within the image instead of a single unified curve the way a sensor or film stock with sufficient dynamic range would have. Stacking prior to the output conversion preserves this workflow (Lightroom's built-in HDR features works this way, which is why it acts like a raw from a higher d-range sensor instead of the weirder HDR workflows you can end up with in other software)

Thrust is equal to mass flow rate times exhaust velocity. Denser propellants are able to achieve a higher mass flow rate so they generally have higher thrust (though lower exhaust velocities).

You can see this with vehicles like Ariane 5, H-IIA, and the Shuttle, which use LOX/LH2 core stages but have to rely on solid rocket boosters for extra thrust during liftoff. Designing a LOX/LH2 engine with enough thrust to serve as a first stage engine is much more challenging than doing so with a LOX/Kerosene engine.

spacex,"Environmental concerns of industrial projects are absolutely valid. However, there are other solutions other than ""yes, go for it, damn the consequences"" or ""no, shut it down, save the ecosystem"". I am Canadian, and for a long time we had an environmental policy of ""no net loss"", meaning that an industrial impact that results in a loss to the environment had to be offset by an equal enhancement to the environment (not necessarily in the same place, but as adjacent as possible). We have moved on from that policy to a ""net gain"" policy, ie if an industrial project is going to negatively impact an area's environment, then the company needs to enhance an area that would result in a gain to the overall ecosystem. Examples are artificial reefs, for example, or planting inter-tidal grasses and providing storm barriers so those areas are protected and can provide protection to juvenile fish.

A 3m x 6.5m long cylinder is ~46m^3. For DragonXL to match that with just the main pressure vessel (so not counting the tunnel through the service module), it only has to be 4.3m long. It's hard to tell from the angle of the [official rendering](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NSF-2020-03-27-18-54-00-196-1170x716.jpg), but that doesn't seem unreasonable.

&gt;And that NASA mightâve been better off requesting a modified variant of Dragon XL

Eh. HALO got sole sourced in the interest of time. Even if SpaceX could have done better, it was NASA's opinion that this was the fastest. It's essentially a suped up node module, like, it was literally previously called the Minimal Habitation Module for a reason. It'll link the crew vehicle (Orion) to their extra supplies and room (DragonXL) and the lander (TBD).

But youâre right, the upside is this will reduce the entry velocity of the rover into Mars atmosphere.  Whether they will continue to lower the orbit over the following months after orbit-insertion, to further lower the entry velocity, I donât know.

But itâs been done both ways in the past.  The US Viking missions in the 1970âs inserted into Mars orbit before deploying the ~~rovers~~ landers.  The Sovietâs Mars 2 and Mars 3 spacecraft released the landers first.  Curiosity (and now Perseverance) donât include orbiters, so they dive right into the atmosphere, of course.",/r/spacex/comments/hmlcar/rspacex_discusses_july_2020_70/fyodvyj/

(Viking landers went into orbit because they had no good imagery to choose a landing site; they needed the orbiters to do mapping first!)

If it's an orbiter, it's probably entering a high elliptical orbit and need to lower and circularize for science operations. Sometimes this is done via aerobraking, though I don't know in this case.

So if you have a lander on an orbiter, and have the dV budget to carry it into orbit (and/or don't want to try to separate for a direct entry, either due to guidance or mapping) you might as well carry the lander into a low orbit. You then have plenty of time to do checkouts and updates and whatnot as well.",/r/spacex/comments/hmlcar/rspacex_discusses_july_2020_70/fyob90n/

Technically: Falcon 9 (this version) has flown 68 times (wikipedia), 26 of which were reuse. The maximum reflight amount has been 5/6 times I believe. I'm aware that Starship has been designed bottom up to be 100% reusable and is a different beast but to go from this to flying hundreds of reuses on the same rocket with very little refurb if any is a huge challenge.

Lets say the technical challenges can be overcome and its safe enough to fly E2E you then have the enviromental factors, where is it going to fly to/from, airports struggle from noise regulations nevermind a rocket like Starship.

You then have legislation which will probably be the hardest/slowest part. Most rockets are launched off the coast heading over the ocean. You've got to convince goverment/legislatures that no one is going to have rocket debry land on their house (unless your china).

At best, the environmentalist would pour through the EIS to find something you overlooked, and file to say ""Well, you didn't consider this part of it"", and seek to pause the action until that part was considered. The effects of choosing a poor environmental outcome are not legal, they're political. 

The Endangered Species Act is different, and requires an agency to refrain from taking adverse impact to a listed species.

I am very close with my family. They ask me what shows they should watch. My parents ask me to fact check things they read on facebook. I run a plex server my whole family uses.

I think when you are close with your friends and family they will be grateful when you consistently share quality content with them.  For instance, I know my friends and family are grateful because they share links back with me on the subjects I share with them.

Just remember a shit ton of people are just browsing facebook garbage that rots their brains and engaging with toxic people online and maybe even toxic bots online.  Me, my sister, my brother in law, and my dad do not use facebook at all. My wife uses it because she talks to her family on it, and my mom does because I am struggling to find a hobby for her and it seems quite frankly that a lot of older people are addicted to facebook.

spacex,"To me the issue looks like heating of the tank walls during reentry. If the heat shield side of the tank gets to 600&amp;deg;C, while the lee side is at \~200&amp;deg;C, the whole frame of the Starship will look like a banana, and heat will be transported by the residual gasses inside the tanks, to the far side, which is good. But heated gas increases in pressure. You don't want the pressure in any tank to get so high that it bursts, You might have to vent residual gas to prevent bursting. You also might have to vent gas from the header tanks, although the thermal inertia of liquid fuel could keep the pressure down, for the minutes between the start of reentry, and the final landing burn.

After landing, as the rocket cools down, you get the opposite problem, which we saw with SN4, I think. If you have vented gas out during reentry to prevent overpressure, then after landing and cooling, he pressure in the tank might get too low, resulting in a crushed tank.

For the LOX tank, you could vent air into them, but for the methane tank, that's not a good idea. You would be making a giant fuel-air bomb. Better to use leftover methane from the methane header tank to adjust the main methane tank pressure.",/r/spacex/comments/hrt56a/starship_sn5_set_for_a_static_fire_followed/fylzj0o/

On the other hand, NASA and the ""old space,"" US contractors have often ""killed"" commercial space by overcharging. It is far smarter to spread the R&amp;D cost over 1000 launches, than to establish a price so high the R&amp;D costs are covered in 2 or 3 launches.

I assume it will basically balanced the whole time if they don't want the craft to fly off too far, so I imagine they won't be using this engine to control roll much if at all.

**Note**: This will be the first webcast I'll be using [my new YouTube API based ""wait for start"" script](https://old.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/h8mold/starlink9_launch_campaign_thread/fx3o1h7/). I planned to use it on the Starlink 9 mission for the first time, but since that got scrubbed, ANASIS-II will now be the premiere. I worked out some kinks that ate up my daily API quota multiple times, but now it should be stable. I'll hopefully be around to watch how it behaves and intervene if anything goes wrong.

As usual, I will relay the SpaceX webcast via HTTPS and the audio stream via Shoutcast on my server, so people with no access to YouTube, experiencing laggy video or with low bandwidth connections are able to enjoy the webcast. If you don't like the web-based player, you can also use the M3U8 playlist in any [HLS-capable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) player - VLC is just one example. The playlist file will become available once the webcast starts, until then you will get a ""404 Not Found"" error. This is perfectly normal.

### Hosted Webcast (Video)

- Watch in your browser: https://codav.de/spacex.html
- Watch with a local player: https://codav.de/stream/spacex.m3u8

I will also provide audio-only streams of the webcasts in two different qualities. High quality (160 Kbps, stereo) for those who want more fidelity and have more bandwidth to spend, and a lower quality (64 Kbps, mono) stream for those on slow networks or with strict volume limits. If you require an even lower bitrate simply drop me a message, I'll add another stream then.

**Important**: The audio streams already loop the [Music for Space album](https://soundcloud.com/testshotstarfish/sets/music_for_space_tss) by /u/TestShotStarfish for your pleasure until the webcast starts, so don't confuse that with the actual webcast. Feel free to tune in at any time.

Here are the stream URLs for use with any Shoutcast-compatible player (WinAmp, VLC etc.):

### Hosted Webcast (Icecast Audio Only)

- High quality (160 Kbps, stereo): http://codav.de:8555/spacex-high.mp3
- Low quality (64 Kbps, mono): http://codav.de:8555/spacex-low.mp3

If you have problems connecting to port 8555 or want to listen in with just your browser, use these reverse-proxied, SSL-secured URLs (stream title display and other ""ICY"" protocol features won't work, as this is using plain HTTP):

It looks as if SpaceX is happy to burn through as many flight articles as it likes, but is looking to limit loss of engines. Presumably, after half a dozen tests, they'll switch to three engines

&gt;  unlikely if an engine goes out youâd be able to save it by starting another engine.

In any case, a redundant engine has to be already running to be able to step in. Consider the several seconds of S2 cooling in and startup time on Falcon 9!

For future human rating, redundancy needs demonstrating from the outset. Just a random suggestion this, but do so without lengthening the critical path, they could be planning to fly a designated engine-redundancy test article, and work towards skydiver flight on another vehicle.

spacex,"&gt; Shuttle and SLS solid boosters are a lot louder than Superheavy

This is surprising, since noise is said to be the main objection to a land-based Earth-to-Earth use of Starship. The Shuttle was planned to be launched from three different pads, all on land.

Its very hard to ""Google"" the"" subject since we find information such as ""the number of decibels at the launch pad"" which is not a base of comparison. 

I'm still looking for a table with decibels or SPL for SuperHeavy *vs* Shuttle as given in the following manner for Saturn V:

* Saturn V produced a Sound Power Level (SPL) of 100W/mÂ² at a distance of 1500 m from the launch pad. [*[ref]*](https://www.e2s.com/system/1/assets/files/000/000/935/935/153711127/original/E2S_-_Sound_basics_-_measuring_power_in_dB.pdf)

spacex,"Not much to discuss, it's already very well studied. 301 stainless has 0.15% carbon and 304L has 0.045% max. Higher carbon content is great for tensile strength because the tiny carbon atoms get into crystal structure dislocations and ""lock"" them together (imagine sliding two pieces of wood across each other, then add some sand and note how much harder it is to slide them.)

Since the grains can't slide relative to each other very well, you can stress the bulk material much further before plastic deformation. But the carbon content has a drawback because when you heat up 301 (as in a weld) you will see chromium attaching to the carbon in the molten metal and sort of falling out of solution as chromium carbide. Since your corrosion resistance comes  largely from the chromium, this means you're ending up with chromium depleted areas wherever you welded. Welds are often already weak points, but once you factor in advanced corrosion, they're gonna break.

304 is generally less prone to this carbide precipitation issue by virtue of having less carbon content (0.08%.) If that's not low enough for you, there's 304L at 0.045%. The 304s also have a higher nickel and chromium content, which makes them more expensive, but this offsets the lack of carbon a little bit.

spacex,"I'm not 100% sure of this, but I think for geostationary launches, using the same launch time keeps all of the burns the same, going to geo transfer orbit.

It shouldn't be that hard to adjust things to get to the target orbit from any time of launch. Basically the plan always is:

1. Launch to LEO
2. Do a second stage burn as you cross the equator. That puts the apogee of the GTO (Geo Transfer Orbit) on the equator.
3. At apogee, the satellite is moving slowest, relative to the Earth. This is the best time to do a plane change. Depending on the mass of the satellite, the plane change burn can be done by the second stage, but for heavier satellites, it is normal for this burn to be done by a kick stage or onboard thrusters. The plane change can be done a little at a time, over several orbits, or all at once.
4. After plane change, the orbit gets circularized. This is usually done by onboard thrusters, and can use quite a bit of fuel.
5. Finally, to arrive at the correct longitude, the orbit can be left just a little high or low, so that the period is slightly more or less that 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.1 seconds. When the satellite gets to the target longitude, a very slight burn matches the orbit to the Earth's rotation.

There is nothing in the above that requires a launch to be at a particular time. You just want to miss the ISS, and any other satellites, so you time your launch to give good margins of safety.",/r/spacex/comments/htptvr/targeting_monday_july_20_for_falcon_9_launch_of/fyjjkcy/

Re-entry is always considered the most dangerous part of the trip.  They test the engines.  They have all sorts of abort procedures during launch.  They can escape from an exploding rocket.  They can burn a little longer if an engine fails to ignite.  

But they can't abort from a re-entry.  It's an all or nothing, one-way trip through fiery, intense heat, and there's not a single thing they can do about it if something decides to fail.

Thx for posting here!

Had SpaceX handled relations with neighbors a little better (particularly as regards financial compensation), the support would be more general.  

I think the environmental impact should not be a ""for or against"" partisan issue. Objective questions need asking, such as noise impact on wildlife during launch. Clearly, Falcon 9 (for which the past studies were carried out) is not SuperHeavy. Consider its effects on birds. We may thus wonder about how its sound propagates underwater, and include its effects on fish.  There needs to be a Superheavy noise model that can be used anywhere else in the context of Earth-to-Earth destinations.

spacex,"While I generally agree with that sentiment, there is a BIT of a hand-waggle from me.

To use a completely unrealistic strawman example, what if we could permanently solve the world's energy crisis, but to do so involved destroying the protected last remaining nesting ground for some animal, effectively guaranteeing it goes extinct? Would the loss not be worth the advantage? Sure, we could try and shove the species into a conservation environment like a zoo, take DNA samples in the hopes of resurrecting them later, etc which would further reduce the ""loss"", but the core principal is ""Is it possible for the gain to humanity to be worth the loss to the natural world?"".

I think we can agree that there IS a line somewhere that as long as the boons are X good and the loss is only Y bad, then it would be crazy not to, it's only really a matter of where that line belongs. Ideally as favorable towards reduced losses as possible, but somewhere losses are going to be inevitable.",/r/spacex/comments/hteqyq/faa_spacex_environmental_review_underway_to/fyhkw11/

I'm a huge SpaceX supporter - you won't find a more enthusiastic one. Most everyone I know around here is the same.

But access to that beach is really important to the people around here. I don't see any good reason to cut off public access to it (except during actual launches and static tests - that's fine, esp. if not on weekends or holidays).

There's an equally nice beach on the Mexican side, but that requires a 90 minute drive, and then re-crossing in to the US afterward, which can take hours (there's often a long line to get thru Customs).

There's a nice beach on South Padre Island - also over an hour away, each way (vs. 10 minutes).

The turtles have been there for ever - nobody (serious) ever proposed shutting down the beach for the turtles - that's just a rotten excuse. There are big signs saying to stay away from turtle nests (which people obey) and not to drive on the dunes (which most people obey - a little enforcement would go a long way).

SpaceX is important. Really important. But it's not the only thing that's important. The citizens of Brownsville shouldn't be made to suffer for SpaceX. 

It's not necessary, and it would only destroy the goodwill that people have for SpaceX.

These human populations themselves along with their industry could easily use the same technology to lift their industrial activities into space, reducing encroachment on the original environment.

Even better, lofting ecosystems into space would over time create enormous redundancy, where every species on Earth today could survive even if the entire planet was blown to bits.

To your second point, well, it seems like you're the one who doesn't understand complex systems. You're thinking of ecosystems like a house of cards: take away one species and the rest comes crashing down. Well, they're not. Ecosystems are complex AND resilient systems at the same time. If one species dies out, ecosystems drive themselves back into equilibrium by increasing/decreasing populations of other species. 

In short, ecosystems have incredible self regulating capabilities. Of course it'll be a dick move to make species extinct through deliberate human action.

There is a minimum elevation below which they are not allowed to transmit to prevent interference with terrestrial users of those bands.

&gt;In fact, as you get further from the equator I would assume the antenna would point closer the equator (with 53 degrees being straight up).

They are also not allowed to transmit within a certain number of degrees of GEO to prevent interference with GEOsats.  This punches a big hole in the southern sky at higher latitudes.

They will probably want to point the boresight north halfway between the minimum permitted altitude and the northern edge of the protected GEO zone.  So somewhere near the north celestial pole. How close will depend on the relative widths of the exclusion zones I mentioned above.

[This document](https://llis.nasa.gov/lesson/759) states that the factory joints were different than the field joints, because they were continuously covered by asbestos/silica insulation, and perhaps were cast already assembled: the phrase ""continuous insulation and propellant strata over the factory joints"" (section 4) seems to imply that they connected the pairs of segments, insulated them, and then cast the propellant.  If they were assembled after casting just before shipping, the insulation/propellant wouldn't have been continuous.

So why not just skip the factory joint entirely?  I found some evidence that maybe they were manufactured in seven sections because of difficulty making steel cylinders large enough out of one piece of metal.  Some [design docs](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19920000825.pdf) for the in-development ASRM booster redesign imply that the case is near the limit of what they were able to forge at the time (p. 15), and welding was considered risky because it was hard to guarantee or detect a defect-free seam.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fygnhpy/

&gt;""[A]pplicants have the right to choose whether to conduct an Environmental Assessment (EA) under FAA oversight or work with the FAA to initiate the EIS process. If an applicant believes the proposed action would have no significant environmental impacts, or that they can mitigate any potential impacts, then the applicant typically chooses an EA,"" wrote Howard Searight, manager of the safety authorization division for the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST).

&gt;""However, all applicants run the potential risk that further review may uncover significant impacts that cannot be mitigated. In those cases, the FAA must conduct an EIS,"" Searight continued in his letter. ""SpaceX has begun an EA for the action of issuing experimental permits or launch licenses to SpaceX for Starship/Super Heavy launch operations at the Texas Launch Site.""

When they launch to the ISS, the launch time gets 24 minutes earlier every day, so that's probably how long it takes (23h 36 min) between times that it passes over the same place.

There are sixteen days between now and splashdown.  16 days x 24 minutes/day = 384 minutes = 6h 24 minutes.

Therefore, if they're splashing down around 3 p.m. EDT, it would be in the same node that the ISS will be at about 9:24 p.m. EDT today.

Looking at the [live tracking map](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/tracking_map.cfm) for the ISS's location, it looks like for both this past orbit and the upcoming one, the path over Florida and/or the Atlantic Ocean was the ascending node.

So, it looks like it's going to be on an ascending node when they re-enter.

The fact that it's happening mid-afternoon probably won't help matters in terms of visibility.  DM-1 re-entered about 2 hours after sunrise in March; this is entering in mid-afternoon in August.

The question is how much methalox propellant is lost per hour from those uninsulated main tanks due to boiloff  while loitering in LEO and how much boiloff loss can be tolerated without compromising the mission. 

So can Starship fly the Apollo 4 mission? That is, can Starship orbit the Earth twice (3 hours) to phase the trajectory correctly for a Boca Chica landing while losing propellant in the main tanks due to boiloff; then fire the Raptors for several minutes in a simulated TLI burn; then coast on an elliptical orbit with apogee around 20,000 km for 4.5 hours while losing more propellant due to boiloff; and then still have enough methalox propellant left after 7.5 hours of flight in the main tanks to do another several minute Raptor burn to increase the speed to 11.13 km/sec?

I don't know the answer since Elon has not shared any information on rate of boiloff from those uninsulated main propellant tanks. 

As I said before, I think Elon should send Starship on a free-return trajectory around the Moon to do this heat shield test. That would test the heat shield in a real lunar return flight, not in a simulated flight. This is what Starship is designed to do: refuel in LEO and then do the TLI burn fairly rapidly after (&lt;2 hours).

And the Service Module uses storable hypergolic propellants .... Starship has methalox propellant in the header tanks but that is needed for the landing burns 

Wait, are you saying that Starship canât loiter in LEO for a few hours, if it has any fuel in the main tanks?  Due to the heat radiating from the Earth in LEO?

Then how will refueling ops work?  Crew Dragon took 24 hours to rendezvous and dock with the space station.  Even Soyuz takes 6 hours.  Starship can probably dock with a tanker quicker than that.  But then you need time to actually transfer the fuel too.

Iâm sure they can eventually speed up the process.  But at first, theyâll surely want to take it slow.  Maybe several aborted docking attempts before success.

On a side note, this got me wondering about whether or not the FH could feasibly lift the James Webb Space Telescope. The Ariane V's fairing diameter is 5.4m while the FH's is 5.2m, but the FH can throw roughly twice as much mass into GTO. It seems like the difference could be made up with a larger fairing without exceeding any structural limits or causing excess aerodynamic instability, but I'm not going to say that with any certainty.

I know putting a payload on a different rocket is a lot more than just matching up the volume and mass requirements, but if the Ariane V launcher that's supposed to send the JWST up is going to be retired in a few years, it might come to that. But then again, Starship would still probably be a better choice.

spacex,"Congratulations again!

I learned some basic information about [SpaceX Dragon 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2#cite_note-10) from wikipedia. The Dragon 2 use x86 to control and PowerPC to actuation, i think those two types of CPU are both customized  for the Dragon 2. Can you explain something about the difference between the dedicated CPU and the ordinary CPU (both x86 and PowerPC)? Whether to include some special instruction sets that ordinary CPU does not have?  And when you are writing code, do you need to do something special to match the dedicated CPU?

As a programmer, I am very curious about flight control software.

Does the flight control software run in the ROM or does it run in the operating system?

If it run in the operating system,  Linux? or some other customized system?

Final question, I only know bit flip will cause program error, so there must be parity. Are there any other conditions that will cause the program to run incorrectly? if so, how to deal with it. I thought about this for a long time, but i can't think of other situations that might cause program error. But! But! i always feel that there will be other situations that will lead to program errors.

spacex,"&gt; If it doesn't get cancelled again last minute

I think what we've been seeing is them canceling the *road closures* at the last minute, not necessarily cancelling the *tests*. We can only see one of those two, and for a long time it seemed like they were closely correlated, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. In fact, I'd say that things seemed to change around the time they got their FAA permit back in May. 

We're not seeing them get set up for a test and cancel it, what it seems like is happening is they're booking road closures for anytime they might want to do a test, and then canceling them if they don't need them. And maybe they're getting a bit lazy or something and not canceling them until the last minute or they're keeping them ""just in case"" they want to move something?

Once we start to signs of activity of a test I wouldn't expect them to cancel it at the last minute. If they find a problem during testing, they'll probably stop the test at that point though.

spacex,"Right, so here's where it gets complicated. It really just depends on how much fuel you want to spend, and how much planning you do.

I've heard that about 3 or 4.5 hours is about the best reasonably possible, and 6 hours I think is the record so far, to get to the ISS. But it takes more fuel to do that.

So if the ISS isn't in an ideal spot, you're going to spend more time, and/or more fuel, in order to get to proper orbit.

Since fuel is expensive, and significantly more fuel is needed to launch that fuel to get into orbit, they tend to work with very thin margins and very little excess fuel.

So the full answer is really that with the amount of fuel loaded onto a falcon 9 for the purpose of getting to the ISS, and the cryogenically cold oxygen required, the launch windows are instantaneous. If you miss the window, there isn't enough fuel on board to get there in reasonable time, and even if there was, it'd be too warm after 35 minutes or so to be used.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fyd2d0s/

spacex,"It's not so much where the ISS is in its orbital plane, but rather how that orbital plane sweeps around the earth (due to the earth's rotation). They want to launch when that plane crosses Cape Canaveral so the capsule's orbital plane lines up. They could probably afford the fuel to adjust the plane a few degrees either way (20 minutes earlier or later corresponds to 5 degrees of plane difference), but that's not enough leeway to detank and start over, so they just aim for the ideal moment.

If the ISS happens to be in the right spot in its orbit at the moment the plane sweeps over the Cape, then a short 6-hour rendezvous is possible.

spacex,"Interesting points but I do have a couple counters:

""Test the SH landing sequence with 3 engines and a 20-100km hop before attempting landings with 20-30 engines""

I don't think we will ever see a 20-30 engine landing,  thrust levels would be way too high (dry mass of SH is thought to be in the 300t range) . Most engine configuration layouts with the current 31 engine booster indicate a center cluster of 7 engines.  The expectation is that the 7 engines or some subset of those 7 which gimble will be used for landing.   

Also when they manage to stick the 20km landing there really isn't much value in doing higher hops.  When they perform the flip / landing burn (SS) they will be at terminal velocity even when falling form 20kms  so there really isn't much difference if they are falling form 20km or 100km or any sub orbital altitude for that matter.  I am certainly no expert here but i would bet that once they stick the 20km landing the next milestone would be orbital.

We are also somewhat confusing the SS and SH here.  I don't think they need a SH for a 3 engine SS  20km hop + land.  The SH testing program will be interesting.  They aren't breaking nearly as much new ground with SH as they are with SS so we may see them do static fire followed by a launch attempt, with RTLS. If it works,  great if it does not it ends up in the ocean,  can't get much safer than that.

And a 2nd test stand far away from the first could alleviate the bottleneck in testing and reduce the impact of a RUD.  

And [u/Acadene](https://www.reddit.com/u/Acadene/)'s theory of this being for a crane isn't out of the question yet either (if not now, it might serve as the foundation for the future one).

The S-IVB stage inserted the spacecraft into a LEO parking orbit. After two revolutions in the parking orbit, the S-IVB stage was reignited for a simulated translunar injection (TLI) burn. The S-IVB was jettisoned and the SM engine was ignited for a short-duration burn to raise the apogee altitude to 9769 n. mi. (18,092 km). 

The CSM coasted for 4.5 hours in an attitude designed to thermally condition the CM ablative heat shield on the conical side of the spacecraft. The SM engine was reignited for a long duration burn and the CM and SM were separated. Atmospheric entry at 400,000 ft (122 km)  occurred with an inertial velocity of 36,629 ft/sec (11.16 km/sec) at a flight path angle of 6.93 degrees. Peak load factor was 7.27 g. The CM splashed down within 10 n. mi. (18.5 km) of the targeted landing point. This was the first recovery of the CM by parachute.

Maximum heat load was 120 kW/m^2. Maximum surface temperature approached 5000F (2760C, 3033 Kelvin).",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fyc4xfk/

A possibility is that 3 of the piles are the 'large' diameter (that is what the previous aerial photo indicated), and 3 of the piles are the small diameter.

However I stand by what I said about the time - they've said that they have ""instantaneous"" launch windows once the fuelling has begun, and during the webcast they mentioned that they only get, at most, 35 minutes. In fact, in early 2016 they scrubbed a launch because of a 20 minute delay, as the oxygen was too warm to use. (See Elon Musk [tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/704102461766676481))

spacex,"One of the pieces that makes it difficult to compare to existing hardware is the phased antenna array. The array is physically flat, which means the elements are likely dual-polarized patches. The FCC filings refer to circular polarization, which can be achieved on a dual linear polarized antenna by phase shifting one of the polarizations by 90Â°.

To achieve beam steerability with null cancelation, you need something like 8x8 dual polarized elements. Maybe you can sparsely populate the array and can get away with 48 different elements or so. The round antenna is probably comprised of a circularly truncated square array.

From here there are two options: independent, low-powered transmit/receive chains for each element and polarization with beam forming done by digitally controlling the phase shifts and amplitudes, OR split a high powered transmit/receive chain with power divider/combiners and perform the beam forming with RF attenuators and phase shifters.

Both of these options necessitate a lot of power on the front end because a lot of power is lost/used along the way. Yeah, in the end the effective EIRP will be something like a 5-10W average power transmitter, but you have to double that because of the polarization and I would guess 5-10x *that* for losses due to the phased array.

Edit: one other reason why I would guess that power range is because IEEE 802.3bt or some of the proprietary PoE standards (like LTPoE++) provide for 71-90W over a standard CAT5E cable to a powered device. Some proprietary standards can push it to 120W and I'm guessing that the engineers were lobbying hard for as much power as possible on the front end so they weren't as constrained on the other end.",/r/spacex/comments/hrlo9m/code_on_spacexs_starlink_website_contains_the/fybot6w/

Dust, sand, soot, salt water, and other contaminants would be an ever present source of problems.

Yes it was shipped in 4 sections, but at the manufacturing plant it originally started as 7 sections total.

I donât know whether it had to be done with each section vertically or not, but if it needed to be vertical then it would have required a rather tall building which may or may not have existed. Also the curing process for the solid fuel, Iâm not sure on the actual limitations on how large of a casting you can do with it (I tried to find some kind of academic paper but was unsuccessful) but that could have added limitations to the size as well. Before the boosters left the manufacturing plant they would join 6 of the 7 sections in pairs and those joints also had the same O-rings that would later be used in the final assembly of the now 4 sections.

spacex,"Huh. Interesting. 

Canât we retrofit those side boosters back to a regular F9 booster with an interstate? Maybe too much hassle when they have 5 active boosters in the fleet and less demand for flight? 

Either way I wonder how long a core can sit around before itâs not worth refurbishing, if that even is a thing. These cores have already been in a hangar since April 2019....

Maybe they are hoping USAF will allow reflight for AFSPC-52 in Q1 2021? Thatâs not thattttt far away? Either way you will still have two brand new side boosters from this next mission just laying around adding the two already in storage...seems like a waste (assuming double drone ship landing goes well, fingers crossed).",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fy9kuj6/
