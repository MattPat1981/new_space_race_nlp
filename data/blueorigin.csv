BlueOrigin,"Just want some advice in my upcoming technical interview. I have seen some advice to just be yourself; dont be afraid to say 'I don't know' to the question; and brush up on engineering fundamentals. I am a recent grad EE major and to be honest I have anxiety when it comes to answering technical questions. I just want to know when the recruiter says to brush up on engineering fundamentals, do they mean like op amps, KVL, KCL, ohms law, etc? Sorry for asking this but I am the type of person that learns the subject but tends to forget it along the way.

I do have a passion in space exploration and a little about myself I have been doing astrophotography for about 10 years and have taken pictures of planets, galaxy,nebula,etc of our universe. To be working on projects to bring human life to space and discover new things around the universe is what makes me enthusiastic in pursuing into space exploration.

It feels NS has been ready to go for ages, i'm not really able to figure out what the holdup is. 2020 is still slated as the year it will happen though.    

BE-4 engines have been shipped to ULA, and they're slated to leave the ground in I think early 2021, but that depends on ULA now more than BO.   

NG is ???, we don't know. There is some hardware being made, the engines are being made, the launch pad is being made, and 2021 is a possible date but it's likely to slip later.

Unfortunately I can't get a really good baseline number to scale everything too.

This recent presentation has lots of slide decks where one can scale off the renderings. There is a little astronaut shown in some of these slide decks but it turns out that the astronaut height isn't a consistent item from slide to slide, resulting in really massive variations that don't make sense to the rest of the components and the integrated stack renderings.

So how big? A true 7 meter payload deck? Or more like 6.35 meters to fit inside the payload envelope provided on the Payload Users Guide?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hitscr/blue_moon_how_big_is_it_exactly/

BlueOrigin,"Eric Berger was awesome enough to post a bunch of photos and info from a National Team webinar that is sharing a bunch of information on the landing system that Blue Origin hasn't put out to the public.

A new rendering of the complete landing system in lunar orbit, gone is the horizontal ""propane tank"" crew cabin: https://twitter.com/SciGuySpace/status/1276184479879647233?s=20

A quick summary of the ascent module Lockheed Martin is providing. Hypergolic pressure fed engine (shuttle Orbital Main System aka AJ10 engine), same as Orion (26.7 kN/6000 lbf thrust and 316s ISP.

A new surface rendering: https://twitter.com/SciGuySpace/status/1276193723823656967/photo/1


There was an earlier picture from Blue Origin listing the lander as capable as 14 tonnes to the lunar surface (I can dig it up and post it if requested). This corresponds VERY well to a 14 tonne wet mass of the ascent element given the ISP, deltaV requirements, and a couple basic assumptions on crew cabin mass etc. One can pretty well work backwards on all the other elements to determine their mass. I estimate the lunar lander has to mass 15 tonnes through TLI. Either New Glenn has to be capable of that or the lander is larger and takes itself through TLI from a GTO-like orbit (which I doubt is the case but one could estimate propellant mass from these renderings and tank volumes).",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hfr0sp/eric_berger_with_blue_moon_details_from_a/

BlueOrigin,"New Glenn has 9+ launches on their manifest. Satellites are generally ordered 2-4 years in advance of the expected launch, and launches are generally ordered 2+ years before the expected launch. This information is usually public: either the satellite buyer or the satellite builder is often a public company, and this is material information. Arianespace (which provides Ariane launches) is also a public company.

Now that New Glenn's initial launch is expected around the end of 2021, a brief 18 months from now, we ought to be able to see a lot of public information about the satellites that are on New Glenn's manifest. So I attempted to look it all up, and here's what I found:

3 GEO satellite launch orders

* 1 for Eutelsat
* Launch order announced March 7, 2017 -- one satellite for launch in 2021/2022, to be selected 12 months prior
* Eutelsat HOTBIRD 13F launch 2021 -- Ariane NET September 2021
* Eutelsat HOTBIRD 16G launch 2021 -- Ariane NET September 2021
* Eutelsat KONNECT VHTS launch 2022 -- Ariane64
* Eutelsat 10B ordered Oct 29, 2019 -- launch 2022 -- no known launch provider -- could be the New Glenn payload
* [No other public satellite orders](https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/sat-contracts.htm)


* 1 for mu Space Corp
* Launch order announced March 12, 2018 for launch in 2020
* Had yet to select a manufacturer at announcement
* [Article from June 16, 2019 says ""as soon as 2021""](https://www.thephuketnews.com/rising-stars-thai-start-up-mu-space-corp-to-launch-space-tourism-in-asian-first-71765.php)
* No known satellite order


* 1 for SKY Perfect JSAT
* Launch order announced March 12, 2018
* Contract does not specify what satellite will be launched
* [July 1, 2018 article says the satellite is yet to be procured](https://spacenews.com/sky-perfect-jsat-mulls-future-technology-investments/)
* [All known previously ordered satellites have launched](https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/sat-contracts.htm)

6+ LEO Constellation launch orders

* 1+ Launch for Telesat
* Launch contract signed January, 2019 for LEO satellites
* [Contract to build LEO constellation has not been awarded to date](https://spacenews.com/telesat-preparing-for-mid-2020-constellation-manufacturer-selection/)
* Telesat has no known GEO satellites on order
* LEO constellation has a deadline to have 30 satellites up by Jan 1, 2023


* 5 launches for OneWeb
* OneWeb is in bankruptcy and may or may not continue deploying their constellation
* The bankruptcy filing lists Arianespace as an unsecured creditor, and not Blue Origin

BlueOrigin,"Long story short, Boeing moved me across the country a little less than a year ago into a job that has not at all turned out to be what I thought it was and I'd really like to get out. Every single day I find myself wading through a tangled, bureaucratic cesspool of archaic processes, procedures, and specifications and its driving me insane. Somehow there are a million procedures for everything and yet no one actually knows how to do anything. Its quite mind-boggling, honestly. 

I desperately need a more modern, faster-paced, and technically-challenging work environment/job. I love aerospace but I'm beginning to realize I simply cannot handle shit loads of paper pushing and bureaucracy. I cannot handle how unbelievably niche and narrow-scoped everyone's job here seems to be. I want to stay in aerospace but I'm wondering if its possible to cut down on the red tape even a little bit in this industry.

BlueOrigin,"Hi, thanks for reading my thread.

I just watched the going to space to save Earth vid (a little late to the party) and thought it was curious that Bezos didn't delve more into how he envisions the extraction of the “limitless resources of space” will actually work. There is a moment where the screen shows a picture of the Moon and it reads “everything we need” or something to that effect however clearly we can't just keep mining the Moon indefinitely for the raw materials needed to build O'Neill Cylinders or it will become hollowed out, there's only so much Moon to mine, and the whole idea is to *not* mine the Earth in the future so I guess that leaves asteroid mining, which would truly provide near infinite quantities of raw materials, precious metals, water, etc. 

For the record as far as I know the economics of asteroid mining are still a bit hand wavey at best and would consider myself “neutral” on the concept, it seems like rather than a source of economic profit for Earth based communities likes those dumb pop-sci articles imply (“The First Trillionaires in Space!”) it would actually work more in a kind of “post scarcity” scenario for humanity like Bezos envisions, perhaps swarms of BO manufactured cheap, expendable AI powered drones mine the asteroids and the raw materials in question aren't a source of significant economic value by themselves due to the inherent near infinite supply, they are just the building blocks of things like O'Neill Cylinders. 

I dunno just kind of puzzled that he didn't go into more detail of “Gate #2” i.e. in-space manufacturing, I mean he did concede no one has any idea how it will work yet but I'm sure he has at least some theories considering the investment he is making in the concept.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/ge3dq4/blue_origin_oneill_cylinders_and_asteroid_mining/

SLS is used to send crew to high lunar orbit using Orion.       
A transfer stage, ascent stage and descent stage are sent to high lunar orbit using 3 commercial rockets or 1 SLS. Then they rendezvous together. Crew moves to this from Orion. 

Transfer stage takes ascent and descent to low lunar. Transfer stage goes back to high lunar. Can be reused next time if fuel supplies arrive.     

Descent and ascent stage lands on moon. Astronauts do blah blah blah.

Ascent stage takes crew back to high lunar. Ascent stage can be reused for next mission if fuel supplies arrive.   

Crew transfers to orion, go back to blue origin (earth).    
For next trip to moon:
Crew goes from earth to high lunar in using SLS/Orion.

New descent stage + fuel supplies (for ascent and transfer) sent to high lunar.

I understand that SpaceX designed their methalox Raptors due to the specifics of ISRU propellant production on Mars.

BlueOrigin,"Given Bezos vision of millions working in cislunar space. Here is how I see it:

1. In near term they should push on making NS and NG commercially successful.

2. Crewed NG.

3. Upper stage outfitting and powerful rockets with big payload fairings to allow launching of space station modules (utilizing the space available in the payload bay + the upper stage is more effective than launching just station modules). Eventually, after ISS is retired, they could build orbital station and lease it to governments and private entities, and use it for their own research.

3. They have to be heavily invested in the lunar program. The moon is the springboard for Bezos' vision. Metals and fuels to mine, low g and no atm to allow for easy and cheap launches - mass drivers and space elevators will also work. It is perfect if you want orbital mega structures. I hope that the Chinese will push forward with the moon too, just to be sure that the space race won't be cancelled again. Bezos can't do this alone without the government, because it is a capital intensive effort with very vague prospects of monetary return. Bezos won't just throw his money down the drain.

A little bit about me: currently a first-year PhD student in materials science and engineering with a focus in metallurgy of additively manufactured (AM) high-temperature shape memory alloys in a top 15 engineering school. Prior to my PhD, I did two materials processes and characterization internships at NASA Langley Research Center (total of 1 year), initially working with carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs), and then AM Titanium alloy. I have BS and MS degrees in mechanical engineering, and have graduate research assistant (GRA) and graduate teaching assistant (GTA) experiences as well. Lastly, I have been involved with a few journal and conference publications (2nd author).

I am passionate in the aerospace materials (metallurgy) field, and space exploration in general. It's impossible for me to count the number of times I've contacted Blue's recruiters on LinkedIn.

The passion, persistence, and experience (and passion for learning) are all there...So, what's really missing?!

BlueOrigin,"Hi Everyone!

I hope it's ok to post more questions here unless there is another thread.

As my title summarizes, a recruiter reached out to me for some positions at BO that are not exactly in my area, however he likes my skill set and we will be working accordingly. He wants to aim at a more general resume for now as we narrow down openings. I have about 4 years of industry experience at some major aerospace companies, and as my ID implies, I did my master's degree in hybrid rocket performance. Just getting a shot at applying is a dream come true! After reading some posts here, I just had a few questions:

1) For my experience level (\~4 years) would 3 pages be too much? My resume is a 2 pager but I was told to expand details, especially on a recent aircraft program that went public that I was on a flight sciences team for. 

2)  Any particular software packages and languages to focus on?  Is Matlab well accepted at BO or shunned due to being tied off a lot by Mathworks? (Seems to always have a camp of dedicated and hater engineers in every R&amp;D group I've been in). 

3) Would stressing NPSS be worth it? This is used for aircraft engines but it was originally aimed at rocketry I believe. 

4) Anything in particular to avoid? 

&amp;#x200B;

BlueOrigin,"For Blue Origin's ""National Team"" for Artemis and the Human Landing System consists of 3 parts: the Lander, Ascent vehicle, and then the Transfer Stage. The latter at first looks to be pretty boring - it's just a tug that takes the two parts from Gateway to Low Lunar Orbit where it is unceremoniously discarded.

What we know of it so far is quite sparse. It will be built by Northrop Grumman, be a derivative of Cygnus (likely the same sattelite bus they use), and be [powered by Blue Origin's BE-7.](https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/10/22/bezos-says-space-industry-stalwarts-will-help-blue-origin-build-moon-lander/)

But thinking on it more I am actually pretty excited about this lil transfer stage. Because it should be a very capable and versatile space tug that can open up a lot of possibilities.

First in order to meet the requirements of the lander it must be capable of holding its hydrolox propellant for over a long duration (at least compared to traditional upper stages). Second it must be capable of autonomous docking.  Finally it is quite likely that this transfer stage would provide all in orbit maneuvering from departing Gateway to orienting the stack in LLO before separation. 

We can take some pretty educated guesses on the total mass of his lander from [NASA's conceptual outline of the 3 stage HLS and the deltaV each stage would provide.](https://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/charts-diagrams/2019/20190404_3-stage-lander-concept.png)  So we see a 12 to 15 tonne stage performing 850 m/s dV* on a total payload of 24-28 tonnes. 

In terms of engines the [BE-7 at 40kN of thrust](https://www.blueorigin.com/engines/be-7) is about 1/3 the size of the RL-10s 110kN, and about double the Orion service module's 26.6kN AJ10. Something to keep in mind.

Knowing that the transfer stage is hydrolox and should have high ISP with BE-7 (guesstimated at 450s), a 4 tonne dry mass stage could take a 28 tonne payload from gateway to LLO using only 7 tonnes of propellant (0.85 km/s dV).  At a glance that looks like quite a bit of extra margin, but around 1.5 tonnes of extra propellant would be needed up front for the transfer stage to get from TLI to Gateway*.

**So what else could this transfer stage do?**

The first thing that comes to mind is that half serious proposal last year to use two commercial launchers to perform EM-1 with Orion instead of SLS. One of the missing pieces was the ability to dock ICPS to Orion. A stretched version of this transfer stage should have no problems there and be able to take Orion from an earth orbit out to TLI. Alternatively the long duration elements of this transfer stage could replace the Orion's primary propulsion and might just be light enough to launch to LEO on New Glenn (I think its close as a quick check). 

Second would be general tug duties. In the near term it could take larger payloads to Gateway or Low Lunar Orbit. While overkill, it could be used to deliver habitation modules that lack their own propulsion system that would otherwise need to be co manifested with Orion on SLS. By staging somewhere before TLI the tug should be able to deliver even larger modules than would be possible with a 2 stage New Glenn.

Long term with refueling it could be used to shuttle all sorts of things around cis-lunar space.

Then there are duties as integrated deep space probe propulsion buses, sort of like what Rocketlab proposes with Photon.   

TLDR I think that transfer stage could evolve to serve a lot of different tasks and it deserves a little more attention regarding its role as a piece of infrastructure in cis-lunar space.

I'm making a Reddit account solely to ask this questions, I have not found any helpful tips elsewhere. I'm very excited to have gotten a call back form Blue Origin two days ago in response to the Program Planning and Control Specialist position I applied to. The recruiter explained I will first have a technical phone screen and then move on to an in-person presentation/panel interview if the phone screen goes well.  
I'm seeking any advice anyone has for this role in particular, there seem to be plenty of posts for engineering positions. I'm not sure what types of questions to anticipate for the technical screening or what type of personality Blue is looking for. The only thing I know is that this would be a dream role and I want to prepare as best as possible for the interview/s. Thank you!

Both designs have been improved too as the old designs were outdated and in some cases a little ugly.

Features include :

\- Upcoming and past launches with powerful filtering tools

\- Reusable first stages

\- Agencies

\- Astronauts

\- Space Stations

\- Events

\- Space News

Our Website - [https://go4liftoff.com](https://go4liftoff.com/)

Our Android App - [http://bit.ly/go4liftoff](http://bit.ly/go4liftoff)

I would like to give a special mention to [u/Nosudrum](https://www.reddit.com/u/Nosudrum/) who supported the project and provided input throughout.

So please take a look around and let me know what you think of our platforms! If you have any issues or recommendations for either of the platforms please do let us know and we'll strive to fix any issues and implement any ideas!

Thank you to the /r/blueorigin mods for giving me permission to post this!

BlueOrigin,"I am flying to Kent in a few weeks to interview for a New Grad Rotation Engineer position, and I was wondering if anyone on this sub had any experience or tips with their interviews. -specifically technical material that I should focus on studying/learning before my interview. 

For context, my experience/focus is on propulsion/fluids/testing. (BS in mechanical engineering)

I want this job more than anything and I just want to be prepared as possible. I know how competitive this position is and I want to put absolutely everything I have into this.  I just don't really know where to begin with preparing other than basic behavioral questions.

BlueOrigin,"Okay, simple question.

BO says the extended version of the lunar lander (which will also be used for crewed landings) can transport 20 tons to the lunar surface.

BO lists the payload to GEO (less energy then TLI) as 13 tons.

So there are three possibilities.

* They will use expendable launches which have no listed payload capacity
* They will use orbital refueling
* They have a third stage??? Was their third stage canceled or could it increase the performance that much?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/eav6lj/is_bo_working_on_orbital_refueling/
BlueOrigin,"Sorry if I’m asking a noob question. As far as I know, going with oxidizer-rich environment is more corrosive for preburner and turbomachinery than a fuel-rich environment. It will also requires expensive super-alloys that can withstand these corrosive environments for multiple reuse. Going with fuel-rich preburner would be less problematic and less expensive. So, what advantages does an oxidizer-rich environment offer over a fuel-rich one that engineers at Blue Origin went with a more difficult engine cycle? What compromises did they make?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/eagaj1/why_did_be4_engine_go_with_an_oxidizerrich/

BlueOrigin,"Blue Origin doubters often like to point to the companies ""lack of progress"" as a sign that the company has been resting on its laurels. This couldn't be further from the truth.

Let's see what Blue Origin has been cooking up the past few years.

* Have built and launched a sub-orbital rocket. Becoming the first people to successfully  land a rocket from space, using rocket engines. Have launched 100 science payloads to space aiding in scientific research.

* They built and are currently developing the BE-4 engine. A very important rocket engine as it will power two future rockets to space.

* They are refurbishing LC36 and upgrading it to launch New Glenn.

* They have built a rocket factory near LC36 which will manufacture and refurbish New Glenn.

* They are currently constructing their rocket engine factory in Alabama. Which will make BE4's.

* They are currently building the New Glenn rocket. Set to launch in 2021.

* They are three years into development of Blue Moon lander, with over seventeen minutes of firing time for the new BE-7 engines.

So on the surface it may appear they are just burning through cash with nothing to show for it, in fact they are not. A lot of the money is used on New Glenn and a lot on infrastructure.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/e920tx/theyve_got_a_ton_of_money_and_theyre_not_doing_a/

I have had interviews with other space industry companies, but Blue has been my white whale. Of all of the space companies out there Blue has the road map I believe in the most, so I know that it is my goal because I will be best able to give back. At this point, I just want to know if I should be doing something different, so I can keep grinding to do what I can to land an interview.

BlueOrigin," I am curious about the general salary range and other benefits. I was afraid of asking these to the recruiter before getting into onsite interview.

For Engineers level 3 what is the salary band? I’ve looked at the Glassdoor and it seems around 110K\~130k? Can it be more? Generally, what is the raise % after 1 year?

Another question is, what is the 401k match %? I also saw in Glassdoor that it is 3%, which seems very low compared to other companies. I also heard that some stocks are given (although BO is not public so can’t liquidate these stocks.) It seems like general opinion is that these stocks are worthless until maybe after 10\~20 years from now that BO maybe do IPO and listed on the stock market.

What other general perks does it provide? I heard that pets are allowed in the office. What about free coffee, free food? What about PTOs? Can I wear t-shirts and jeans to office? Any free EV car charging? Commuter benfits like subsidizing vanpool, shower facility for bicycle riders, etc?

Any info will be greatly appreciated. 

Plus, if you rather share via PM, I can also share via PM about compensation info for Boeing.

By the way, Boeing does not provide free food at all. No free coffee either. The cafeteria is served by Eurest and its food cost is around 8bucks minimum and the quality is subpar.

Boeing has good commuter benfits, pays out vanpool or bus card upto 60bucks. Most building has very good shower/locker for bike commuters.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/dpft1j/what_are_blue_origin_salary_and_other_perks/

BlueOrigin,"I posted this on the Spacexlounge subreddit, but I would like to know Blue Origin's fan perspective on this issue.

As many space fans know, SpaceX is hard at work on their new revolutionary Starship. A fully reusable spaceship that will take humans to the moon and back. The first prototypes are already being built at a breakneck speed using their revolutionary construction method that has cut down on cost and complexity.

Starship will launch to orbit by the end of next year and shortly thereafter carry crew, according to SpaceX. Elon Musk has said the cost will be less than a Falcon 9 rocket, perhaps ten million per launch. It can land, get refueled and launch again, with out refurbishment, just like an aircraft. This means that spaceX will offer cheap, safe access to space.

Now the problem for Blue Origin is that their rocket is only partially reusable. Even if it's cheaper than a Falcon 9 (though it will be more expensive because it will have to recoup development costs), they won't be able to offer competitive prices, compared to what Starship will offer. This is problem for long term growth of the company. How will they get payloads when Starship undercuts them on price?

The question then is, how will blue origin compete with Starship? Perhaps the upper stage of the New Glenn could be converted into a reusable ship, but at this stage they don't have much experience even flying to orbit let alone designing and building such a complex spacecraft. They need an answer, but I'm not sure what it will be.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/djy32v/can_blue_origin_compete_with_starship/

Credit to NASASpaceFlight Forums's member Su27k for finding the link.

Summary of relevant section:  After consultation with Blue Origin, NASA says the smaller LUVOIR-B version can be launched on New Glenn.

The report also states that New Glenn will be undergoing a Critical Design Review around this time of 2019, and the factory in Cape Canaveral is being completed and will be populated with tooling late this year.

Sounds like Blue Origin will start to bend metal on its first New Glenn flight article once 1) the design passes the CDR, 2) the BE-4 completes flight qualification testing, and 3) the factory construction is complete and the tooling installed.  So figure beginning of 2020 for construction of the first finalized-design New Glenn to start in earnest.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/cyszqr/nasas_luvoir_final_report_released_82619_mentions/
BlueOrigin,"Hey everyone, 

Blue just posted their internship application for next summer and I have a (stupid) question. There is a section that simply states ""Write a 250-word (or less) statement on your passion:""

For those who have had success applying in the past, is this section where I should explain my passion for the space industry? Or is it more of a writing sample and I can explain any passion (space related or not)? Just curious, because I'm sure nearly every response is related to a passion for space and they probably end up being pretty boring/repetitive for the reviewer.

So I've steadily watched Blue Origin's Glassdoor rating *plummet* (see the graph) over the past couple years. This is an especially good forum for you current and former employees, contractors, etc. to chime in. 

*Is it worth wanting to or going to work for this company in a couple years if this is the current employment outlook?*

I've heard, read, and seen several things on Glassdoor and in other places...

* Meaningless stock options
* ""Yes men"" culture
* Bad technical management
* Aggressive middle managers
* ""Back-stabby coworkers""
* Low pay
   * Seattle is becoming more expensive to live in
* Bad working environment: (Shrinking desk sizes, gimmicky open office floor plan)
* Kent isn't a nice place to live

BlueOrigin,"The 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing has caused me to ask a question: what testing will Blue Origin do of the Blue Moon hardware?

Back in the 1960s, NASA created the [Lunar Landing Research Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Landing_Research_Vehicle) to study how they were going to land a vehicle on the Moon. The vehicle consisted of a jet engine pointed downwards, generating enough thrust to simulate the Moon's one-sixth gravity, and other rockets to provide fine control. (This is a similar concept to the earlier Rolls Royce's [Flying Bedstead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Thrust_Measuring_Rig), which led to the Short SC1 and the Harrier Jump Jet).

More recently, NASA have invested in  [Project Morpheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Morpheus), a methalox VTL lunar lander test rig. Masten Aerospace are developing testbeds such as the [XL-1T](https://www.masten.aero/xl1t) to test lunar landing technologies.

So, what are the odds that Blue Origin produce some form of crewed or uncrewed lander, perhaps using a BE-8 as well as a jet engine, to test their systems here on Earth?  They have a certain track record with vertical jets, with their initial Charon VTL system.

Whilst modern computer systems allow simulations that reduce the need for as much hardware testing, it seems likely to me that we'll see some sort of system being tested within the next year. It's costly, but it should reduce mission risk.

Or will they just manage without such a system?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/ch44mw/blue_moon_hardware_testing/

BlueOrigin," I still have software to develop, but hardware is fairly mature. 

Battery pack is custom, such that I can distribute the weight more freely. Both circumference-ily and in the Z axis.

Control is taken care of by 2 perpendicular servos and control surfaces. 

Orientation comes from a gyro and accelerometer. 

Software sits (will sit) inside a microcontroller.

Thrust comes from two opposite rotating propellers.

Communications is with Bluetooth. I also have another transceiver, not sure of the band it uses.

BlueOrigin,"So Bezos talks a big game about building space infrastructure for future generations but it seems that there is no real clarity on what he actually intends to do. Right now, the talk is only about rockets. But that's the easy (relatively) part. What's the plan after that? Will BO only be a very affordable launch provider? Will they fund a moon/mars base etc? 

SpaceX and Musk are very clear in that they want to go to Mars and build a base there. Its a specific actionable plan. Bezos' idea is to move industries to space while we turn earth into giant nature park / residential zone. Its too vague. I imagine that a lot of research and re-work would need to be done for industrial processes that work on earth to work in space. That's stuff that the industry leaders and experts would need to do themselves. Bezos can't do it for them. Maybe he sets up a r&amp;d office to work on tech to build o'neil cylinders?

BlueOrigin,"I have no doubt that we can build viable O'Neill Cylinders - at some point.  It is ""just"" an engineering problem and we are very clever when it comes to technological solutions.  So far in our discussions, this subreddit seems entirely focused on the construction/technology of Cylinders.  That seems like the easy part.

My concerns are more about what life in such a environment would be like.

In particular, the Cylinder appears very fragile to hull damage.  A relatively small breech (compared to the entire hull area) leads to significant loss of atmosphere unless repaired quickly.  The centrifugal force will actively and rapidly vent the air.

Consider a resident hostile force intentionally set on destroying life in the Cylinder.  Perhaps they threaten destruction unless paid a ransom, perhaps they are politically motivated.  Using today's words we would term it a ""terrorist"" organization.  It seems that their mission would easily succeed with little effort.  It wouldn't take much tech to catastrophically damage the hull.  They would probably strike in multiple, far separated locations.  Certainly they would die as well, as self-proclaimed ""martyrs"", undoubtedly.

How could we guard against this occurrence?

Of necessity, I think the government would likely engage in extensive surveillance of the populace.  It seems likely they would take a heavy authoritarian, militaristic approach.  I'm postulating a paranoid streak in the government due to the perceived danger.  The government would be constantly suspicious of their citizens.  I think there would not be much personal freedom, consequently.  (Hello, big brother.)

But a hostile force wouldn't even need access to the interior.  They could stand off at a distance with a mass driver and take out the Cylinder.

That factor leads to the necessity of an external mobile security force for the Cylinder, quite robust.  I'm not sure how even that force would protect against incoming masses at high velocities.  As usual, government support of such a defense team drains more productive activity.

Given these dangers, I'm not sure putting millions of people at risk is a such a good idea.  While I really like the *idea* of O'Neill space colonies, I think they have serious problems due to human behavior issues.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/c8x2g5/the_future_in_oneil_cylinders/

BlueOrigin,"I've been thinking about how Blue Origin will test the New Glenn to qualify it as Operational.

While it could be deployed like the Saturn V, I think this unlikely.  As a quick review, the Saturn V program used an ""all up"" scenario.  Each of the parts, including the complete stages, were ground tested completely.  Finally, the whole rocket was integrated and flown.  The point being that the first time any parts of the rocket flew, it was as a whole Saturn V.

In my opinion, it seems implausible that BO will use this technique for the NG.  The primary motivation for ""all up"" testing of the Saturn V was expediency.  (After all, it was a real space race.)  BO seems to believe in intentional slow development.  ""All up"" testing seems counter to the ""step by step"" and ""slow and steady wins the game"" Blue Origin philosophy.

Thus, I have a hard time imagining that Blue Origin would build a complete New Glenn and launch it for recovery on their ship as the first flight in ""all up"" fashion.  

I think it much more likely that we would see ""hopper"" tests with a reduced first stage, followed by hopper tests with gradually more elaborate first stages, leading to a test of a ""production"" first stage.  Likewise, landing on the actual recovery vessel will occur only in the latter first stage tests.  Why risk an expensive vessel until you have  greater confidence in the test article?  Instead, we will see land-based recovery early in the testing.


Since the second/third stages use vacuum-optimized engines, I don't see a good method of testing them except in flight atop a first stage.  Perhaps some aerospace engineer can elucidate?

In any event, we should have significant, unambiguous, public notice when Blue Origin commences testing.  You can't launch without FAA clearance, after all.  There aren't any secrets, there.

I also speculate (without any real data) that Blue Origin is looking at a year or more of testing prior to a complete flight profile (recovery included).  This is Blue Origin, after all.

So in order to hit a ""2021 New Glenn is operational"" milestone, we should see testing start by the beginning of 2020.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/bt8ins/speculation_on_new_glenn_testing_program_aka_how/

BlueOrigin,"On April 26th Blue Origin Tweeted out a Cryptic message saying simply [5.9.19](https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1121797276190437376) with a picture of the [Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, the Endurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_\(1912_ship\)).  So far, nothing is known for sure on what the announcement will be, but that hasn't stopped people from speculating:

BlueOrigin,"   Let's face it, Old Space concepts/ mission architectures are (within the next few decades at least) going to become very outdated at the rate that SpaceX is progressing with Starship/Superheavy. With that being said Blue Origins mission design for sending humans to the moon should not resemble Apollo but rather should resemble starship instead. Even if some performance is lost with having to carry a side mounted heatsheild around the sheer quantity of performance you get from a Starship style upper stage with orbital refueling is enough to justify the incured performance loss, 

   Overall the Space industry needs to transition from designing missions to land a few astronauts on the moon- mars to launching dozens of people at a time. This is why I think BO should design a integrated upper stage vehicle for New Glenn. For tourist flights the cost incurred by throwing away the upper stage after every flight is too much to be competitive. This is why I think New Glenn should have a Starship style upper stage rather than a traditional upper stage.

p.s - having what is essentially a hydro lox version of Starship would give BO a tremendous advantage over SpaceX in Lunar Operations because BO could take advantage of Lunar ISRU while SpaceX couldn't since there is little to no carbon on the moon.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/biv32n/unpopular_opinion_bo_should_build_an_integrated/

BlueOrigin,"   Earlier today I was thinking about something relating to New Glenn. We know for a fact that After Blue is satisfied with their tourists flights on New Shepherd they are planning on starting manned orbital flights on a New Glenn capsule. While the margin exists for New Glenn to send such a capsule into LEO with just 45 tonnes to LEO it wouldn't have the power to send the Capsule on Trans Lunar Injection. With that being said is there any way that New Glenn could be uprated in terms of thrust and payload capacity to launch manned lunar missions or will we have to wait for New Armstrong? (mid-2030's)

BlueOrigin,"Blue Origin produced the New Shepard rocket with minimal mishaps. The second iteration of New Shepard, NS2, became the first booster rocket to perform a vertical landing after returning to space. The rocket flew to space a total of *five times*. NS2 was not expected to survive its fifth and final flight, as the mission included a high velocity separation of the passenger capsule which was outside of its design parameters. The rocket, however, was never made aware of this fact and landed itself perfectly anyway. 

NS2 now decorates the lobby of the Blue Origin factory in Cape Canaveral as a testament to the tenacity of a booster that was developed with reuse in mind from the start, and for which every precaution was taken to make it reliable for multiple reuses. New Shepard is poised to become the first private rocket to take humans into space. 

This same approach is being used in the design and production of the next Blue Origin rocket, the much larger New Glenn. Having demonstrated reusability with NS and learned many lessons in doing so, the New Glenn will likewise be designed for reuse from its very first flight. The rocket's design is deliberate, as is its mission, and reuse will not be added as an afterthought. 

The main engine of the New Glenn, the BE-4, has already impressed the industry, and inspired so much confidence that it will also be used as the main engine of the ULA Atlas V rocket. BE-4 is also looking to become one of the first, if not the first, ever LOX/methane-fueled engine to bring a rocket into space.

Blue Origin has also made huge strides towards the production and facilitation of the New Glenn rocket, as is made evident by the enormous Blue Origin factory constructed at Cape Canaveral, and to which another huge expansion is already being made. Blue Origin has leased Launch Complex 36 to facilitate launches of New Glenn, and construction around the site is literally transforming the landscape. And as if that weren't enough, Blue Origin is also in the process of refitting a massive freighter ship into an even more massive landing pad for New Glenn - because, again, New Glenn has been designed with reuse in mind from the very start.

When New Glenn launches, it will be faraway the largest, most ambitious rocket in the world, and it has already secured contracts for launches with both private companies as well as government. So while some may tell you that Blue Origin is getting 
nowhere simply due to a persistent social media presence, I would like this thread to remind people that Blue Origin has done great work and will likely keep doing great work - because we have been given no reason to doubt them yet.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/bbabzi/the_really_unpopular_opinion_gradatium_ferociter/

BlueOrigin,"   Let's face it, with all the innovations they have been able to make in such a relatively short period of time. SpaceX is quickly becoming what most people talk about when they refer to the apex of the aerospace/launch industry. The main thing that has driven SpaceX's innovation is the sense of urgency and the aggressive timelines that are placed on the employees while stressful yields some impressive results that are not only amazing in technical terms but also fairly cost effective. Robert Zubrin always says that SpaceX was able to do what NASA is doing with SLS for ""1/3 the time at 1/10th the cost.""

While there are definitely clear benefits to not rushing and rapidly iterating to the point where no two vehicles are the same. The amount of dilly-dallying that Blue Origin is doing given the resources that they have is at this point (IMO) unsustainable and just not going to work. For innovation to occur teams working for any company need to have a sense of urgency to fulfill their timelines, and with BO I am afraid that the lack of that is putting strain on the companies ability to deliver, I mean look at it like this.

SpaceX was founded a whole two years after Blue Origin and within 6 years they had their first orbital vehicle flying (Falcon 1).
It took Blue Origin a full 15 years to just fly a suborbital vehicle. And four years later they are still stuck in test-flight limbo despite not having a single RUD after 10 test flights. While I was hoping the incrementalism would pay off for New Glenn I sadly don't think this is going to be the case. BO is already begging the Airforce to postpone their second round EELV contracts because they don't think New Glenn will be ready by then (2024). IMO their sluggish pace is starting to catch up with them and not in a good sense. Bezos likes to talk about how results are more important than timelines or petty ""races"" which I somewhat agree with, but what I think he fails to realize as that those kinds of results don't happen without a sense of urgency. At this point at their current pace It pains me to say this but I can't see New Glenn flying until 2024, I can't see them flying humans into LEO until 2030 (which by that time SpaceX probably will have landed humans on mars) And we might have to wait until 2040 for New Armstrong which would be embarrassing considering SpaceX probably will have been flying Starship for upwards of 18 year by then, birth to legal adulthood. 

While I am a SpaceX fan (you can probably tell by my username) I really love Blue Origin as well and I want them to succeed almost as badly as I want SpaceX to be successful. If Musk is inspired by ""The Case for Mars"" then Bezos and BO are inspired by ""The High Frontier"" I see both martian colonization as well as a robust cis-lunar infrastructure and economy as complementary as well as mutually beneficial to one another which is why I want both to succeed. However I just don't see that happening with their current business philosophy, which Is why I think it needs to change if BO is to accomplish their long term goal of millions living and working in space in the first place.

P.S - I know this kind of thing may come off a controversial but please don't down-vote simply becasue you disagree with my opinion. Instead please give me some substance as to why you disagree in the form of a comment, Thank you.

Also - While the timeline is agonizingly slow I applaud BO for making their first orbital rocket borderline Super Heavy. Since that will likely make scaling up to New Armstrong much easier.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/bb36lq/unpopular_opinion_gradatium_ferociter_is_not/

BlueOrigin,"&gt;**Reusing rocket upper stages**. Blue Origin is [considering](https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-studying-repurposing-of-new-glenn-upper-stages/) repurposing the upper stages of their upcoming New Glenn rocket for use in orbit, possibly as habitats. (Development of [New Glenn](https://www.blueorigin.com/new-glenn/) remains on schedule for launch in 2021.) A group consisting of NanoRacks, SSL, and ULA has also [studied repurposing orbital rocket bodies](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/nasa-funds-partnership-to-explore-making-space-habitats-out-of-used-rocket-fuel-tanks) as part of NASA's [NextSTEP](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nextstep-partnerships-develop-ground-prototypes) program. That proposal would involve an Atlas 5 upper stage refitted with life support and attached to the ISS or another station. Repurposing of upper stages in orbit makes sense when considering the energies involved with returning them to the ground for reuse. An upper stage may be moving at up to 8 km/s, compared to \~2 km/s for returning first stage boosters. Decelerating for reentry at those speeds requires a large amount of fuel, heat shielding, or both. The Space Shuttle and SpaceX's proposed Starship are examples of upper stages that return to Earth for reuse using heat shields (or hypothetically “[transpirational cooling](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starship-bleeding-transpirational-atmospheric-reentry-system-challenges-2019-2)” in the case of Starship).

BlueOrigin,"   Some Blue Origin employees visited our school recently and I struck up a conversation with one of their representatives about their long term plans for human spaceflight.
   She didn't go into too much detail (as per company policy) but she did drop some interesting details to me personally. She made it very clear to me that Blue Origin believes vehemently in heavily researching and developing technologies before implementing them, and when researching technologies and architectures their main priority is how much something can be scaled.
   
   After prefacing her statement with that, she then added something very interesting, though I'm paraphrasing this is essentially what she had said to me ""Crew Capsules, parachute landing, pusher abort. Those things are just as scale able as Propulsive landing of the Booster stage on New Glenn"". 

   I took that to mean that something like the crew capsule and abort system on New Shepherd will likely be scaled up to 7 meters in diameter to match New Glenn to carry people (10-15) into orbit and potentially this could even be scaled up to New Armstrong which (assuming 12-15 meter diameter) would allow for something like 30-50 people to go into orbit, making the prospect of having millions of people living and working in space not too far fetched.

   Despite what this representative told me, I remember hearing somewhere that the capsule design doesn't scale very well past a certain diameter (~5m or so) Is there any truth to that and If so why does Blue see this as the best option for manned spaceflight going into the future at larger scales?

BlueOrigin,"   I can't stop thinking about how much of an impact Jeff Bezos and his company will have on our future as a space faring civilization. While we might still be in the barnstorming phase of commercial spaceflight now with New Shepherd's suborbital flights and development on their first orbital heavy class launcher New Glenn. The simple difference in scale between New Shepherd and New Glenn leaves no doubt in my mind that whatever comes after New Glenn (New Armstrong and others perhaps) will be on an equivalently grander scale.

  I started thinking about how Blue Origin could build the ultimate Cis-lunar transportation network and I think I was able to boil it down to a few main modular components. With just six main components Blue Origin could kick start a vast Cis-lunar infrastructure that would allow for Bezos's large scale entrepreneurship in space as well as things like in space manufacturing, mining and construction. All these things will eventually be needed for the millions living and working in space followed by their trillion+ descendants.

   *Component 1 ; The Rocket booster*

The first component would be a first stage booster, similar but not totally like the one on New Glenn. Aside from being powered by liquid methane and liquid oxygen all other similarities to new Glenn would be purely aesthetic in nature. This booster would be far bigger than New Glenn's probably between 12-15 meters in core diameter and possibly larger at the base to accommodate more engine bells. I expect it to be powered by a next generation methane powered engine (perhaps Be-5). I expect that this booster will be prohibitively large to allow for barge landings out in the ocean. Because of it's size I expect this booster to instead preform a boost-back burn and return to the launch site so that money is saved and turnaround times are quickened.

*Component 2 ; The reusable orbit shuttle*

Launched atop the booster I imagine a vehicle very similar to SpaceX's BFR in most respects, however, this is not an interplanetary spaceship but rather a reusable shuttle designed to launch up to 200 tonnes of payload as well as dozens of crew and passengers into a low earth orbit. How it will re-enter and be reused is anyone's guess, but I tend to think of a vehicle that is 12-15 meters wide/ Cylindrical with a side mounted heat shield and aero control surfaces for re-entry as well as propulsive landing ""because it scaled very well -Jeff Bezos"". For commonality with refueling and space based infrastructure I expect this vehicle to be hydrogen powered, although there is a 30% payload sacrifice. The orbit shuttle now has commonality in refueling and manufacturing with other components in this Cis-lunarr transportation system.

   *Component 3 ; The space tug*

   This hydrogen powered stage is built on earth but launched into LEO by the Orbit shuttle. It is completely space proofed with ample amounts of insulation as well as simplified engine plumbing to allow for less maintenance and less wear and tear on the engines. Weather it's taking a satellite from LEO to GEO or picking up crew and cargo from LEO to take to a Low lunar orbit. This jumbo sized hydrogen powered space tug can do it.

   *Component 4 ; Lunar Ascent/Descent tug*

Very much similar to the Space tug with a lower fuel capacity and a shorter overall length along with modified avionics and landing struts. This vehicle picks up cargo/Crew modules from the Space Tug and takes them down to the lunar surface to be offloaded by crane and have new things stacked on to be taken and linked up with a space tug in lunar orbit.

    *Component 5 ; the fuel tank*

This fuel tank module would allow for rocket fuel to be transported around Cis-lunar space since it would hook up to the front of the tug stage and could be docked with other tanks to assemble fuel depots in LEO, EML-1,2,4,5, or even in LLO. Tanks would be fairly simple autogeneously pressurized Hydrolox tanks with heavy insulation to prevent boil off as well as power hookups for refrigeration and pressure regulation.

   *Component 6 ; Crew Cargo module*

Cylindrical modules that could be launched attached to the front of a tug stage and subsequently to a lunar descent stage, capable of carrying either cargo or crew.

BlueOrigin,"   Gateway foundation website; https://gatewayspaceport.com/the-gateway/

   Many of you have probably heard of the gateway foundation. A retired cargo 747 pilot by the name of John Blincow. He started the gateway foundation about 5 years ago with the express hope of building rotating space station/ spaceports in LEO, to provide humanity with it's first serious pieces of space infrastructure. The only problem here is funding. The gateway foundation in my mind has good intentions but their funding scheme is suspiciously reminiscent of Mars One. It's essentially a private lottery in where people pay for a shot at an all expense paid trip to the station/ Spaceport, though there is vast evidence to suggest that they are legitimate (Having engineers/ aerospace professionals employed by their non-profit as well as talks with SpaceX/ Thales Alenia... ect) I don't believe the private lottery idea will work for the amount of funding that they need. Which is why I think blue origin would be a really good sponsor for them. Blue Origin wants to send tourists into LEO aboard New Glenn, but where do they expect to have those tourists stay once they're are up there? Blue Origin could use wings specializing in Space Station design and orbital construction and manufacturing. After all space tourism and orbital manufacturing are the main long term goals for BO and Bezos as a whole, why not put them under the wing of blue and provide them with some financing?

BlueOrigin,"How does the world respond to an operational New Shepard? I personally believe that space tourism even of a limited suborbital kind is going to completely change how we think about what is possible in space. Particularly I think it is going to show the industry that you can make money off of human space flight and open the floodgates to VC money and investor interest in things like space hotels, orbital transport, and space advertising.

My only evidence for why I think this is so is that we have seen this before. I remember going to conferences back in 2012/2013 where seasoned industry veterans and space cadets alike thought that commercial satellite launch was a nonstarter and that something like SpaceX was an anomaly caused by a particularly passionate billionaire. Fast forward to today and there is a ton of VC money being thrown at launch startups like Relativity, Firefly, and Vector. I think this is in part due to the fact that the success of SpaceX as a commercial launch company showed to the world that this is an industry you can be successful in and lowered the financial risk in many people’s minds.

I totally understand that the small launcher boom is also fueled by the rise of small satellites and mega constellations. I would also add that in this domain a lot of heavy lifting had to be done by early entrants like Planet Labs and Skybox to convince the world that there was money to be made.

Do you think that Blue Origin (and virgin galactic’s) decades of investment in space tourism will cause a similar paradigm shift? Will this make it easier for companies like NanoRacks, Axiom, Space Adventures and Bigelow to find the funding they need to execute on their business plans?

BlueOrigin,"   Blue Origin has now been testing New Shepherd for almost 4 years, they have now had 10 successful test flights, with the booster ever being able to land during the in-flight abort test. So far things have been progressing well and they now have a class of new shepherd that is fully capable of flying humans, yet Jeff Foust recently tweeted that the current goal at BO for flying humans in by the end of this year (meaning 2019). My question is what more does BO have to do before flying paying customers on New Shepherd, perhaps 2 more flights? 1) an uncrewed dress rehersal of the crewed flight operations and profile (NS-11, NET May 2019). Then perhaps a test flight with trained test pilots. (NS-12, NET August 2019), then perhaps NS-13 would be the first flight with paying customers, possibly NET November 2019?

BlueOrigin,"   I've lately been caught up in thinking about what the long term goals of Blue Origin are and how they might facilitate and achieve these goals. In comparison to SpaceX I see them as having a more linear development path whereas I see Blue Origin going for an exponential development path (similar to amazon, Bezos; ""While our competitors are looking 3-5 years ahead we are looking 7 years ahead"") In where things move slow in the beginning but eventually they reach a hockey-sticks curve and start accelerating faster and further than anyone would have originally realized. 

   This is what I see happening with Blue Origin, while the first 20 years might seem slow I see a point (perhaps when New Glenn starts maturing [mid 20's]) When Blue begins a period of exponential growth and expansion in their space operations, perhaps in the late 20's or early 30's right about this time I expect New Armstrong will make it's debut and I think it could be something far more than we might initially expect, look at the scale difference between New Shepherd and New Glenn as a predictor of this trend.

   I recently had some speculation about what New Armstrong could be and I'd like to share that with everybody here, not only is it more than we might expect but I believe that this vision fits Bezos's vision like a glove. New Armstrong in my idea is 4 Things, a system and not just a super heavy class launch vehicle. This system is centered on four main parts, a methalox booster stage, a LEO shuttle, a large station transfer station in LEO, and a lunar shuttle. 

   Allow me to explain why this model fits Bezos's vision so well.
 
   What good is sending tourists into space if they have nowhere to go? a large transfer station would give tourists riding on Blue Origin rockets a place to go, and it would also allow for two other vital things besides tourism, a place to store fuel for outbound lunar shuttles, and a transfer point for logistics. Lunar bound payloads could be offloaded in LEO transferred to a Lunar shuttle that has been fully fueled and sent there without having to do this all at once.
   
   Bezos has expressed the importance of building vital infrastructure for smaller space entrepreneurship, a station would give these entrepreneurs a place to do their work as well as a port to operate out of. The booster stage of the New Armstrong system would be similar to New Glenn's booster stage merely scaled up, my guess is that is will be somewhere in the 10-12 meter diameter range and because of it's size will preform a boost back burn to return directly to the launch site rather than landing on a ship like New Glenn. The next part of the system would be the LEO and Lunar Shuttles, In general they would have much in common but also many key differences, They would both be cylindrical in shape and be built on the same assembly lines with the same tooling but would serve rather different functions. The LEO shuttle would be fitted with a heat shield as well as several dynamic control surfaces for rentry and landing (much like BFR) I would also expect this vehicle to use a vacuum version of BE-4 Becuase higher thrust for launches to LEO is better for minimizing gravity losses, The lunar shuttle on the other hand would be very different. The lunar shuttle would launch on top of the booster but would never come back to land on earth ever again, instead it would dock and rendezvous with the LEO transfer station where it would be refueled and sent on trans lunar injection to land at a moon base. The lunar shuttle would have approximately the same shape as the LEO shuttle, perhaps a little longer due to the lesser density of it's hydrogen fuel, but would have no heatsheild and permanently fixed landing legs, all in all a simpler vehicle. After completing it's mission on the moon it would be refueled there from the water ice at the poles and insert itself back into LEO propulsively where it would dock with the transfer station and get ready to return to the moon. All in all this system would develop many of Blues skills including, In space construction (for the transfer station) Re-entry and landing capabilities from the LEO shuttle, Water ice mining and Lunar Ops for the lunar shuttle as well as in general boulstering the backbone of a space economy through transport infrastructure on a level we have never before seen in the past. 

   To sum up all I've said, I think Blue origin will make New Armstrong dedicated to infrastructure rather than just as a traditional launch vehicle for customers to help fulfill their long term vision, they will also IMO focus a division of the company on space stations and in space construction and manufacturing, so as to one day have the skills to build they giant space habitats that Jeff Bezos is so fond of.

BlueOrigin,"   Clearly part of Jeff Bezos's motivation for founding Blue Origin was Gerard Oneill's ""High frontier"" concept of Cislunar and eventually most of the solar system's space being populated with giant rotating space megastrucutres in where humans could have access to much more habitable space than being confined to earth. Supplemented by the mining of asteroids, the solar system could eventually support trillions of humans. My question is however about the social and economic consequences of this plan.

   Of course early on in the construction of these rotating megastructures, rents on these space colonies will likely be quite high as the cost of getting into space will be far less than it is now, but still not as cheap as airline travel or something comparable, My question is this. What is to prevent an Elysium type situation from occurring in where the wealthiest of earths population decides to leave for these rotating megastrcutures and the poor are left on earth?

   Surely nothing good could come from this, and I could only imagine that the situation on earth would degrade further, with capital investment leaving as well as a higher proportion of people living in poverty, Earth wouldn't be preserved nearly as much as Jeff Bezos had hoped, in fact the situation kind of reminds me of Blade Runner, earth suffers degradation because the wealthy and well off have left for the off-world colonies.

Looking at data from today's NS-10 launch, it accelerated 13.4 ft/s\^2 early on in the flight between the 10 and 15 sec marks, roughly 110 ft/s - 43 ft/s, so 110-43 / 5 = 13.4

NASA Goddard Space Flight Center | Cooling tightly-packed electronics onboard a spacecraft can be challenging, and many solutions have not been able to undergo robust testing. Principal Investigator Franklin Robinson will test one of these solutions in his Flow Boiling in Microgap Coolers experiment.
NASA Johnson Space Center |  On its third flight on New Shepard, the Suborbital Flight Experiment Monitor-2 (SFEM-2) led by Dr. Katy Hurlbert will analyze various aspects of the flight environment during New Shepard’s mission profile, measuring cabin pressure, temperature, CO2, acoustic conditions, acceleration and more. The data collected will help future researchers on New Shepard design the most effective experiments for the vehicle.
Purdue University | Dr. Steven Collicott’s payload looks at Zero-Gravity Green Propellant Management Technology, which aims to help advance the use of a safer and more environmentally friendly rocket propellant by better understanding the fuel’s behavior in microgravity.
University of Central Florida | Two teams led by Dr. Josh Colwell and Dr. Addie Dove both have planetary science payloads on NS-10. The Collisions Into Dust Experiment (COLLIDE) aims to understand how dust particles react after surface contact during exploration missions to places such as the Moon, Mars and asteroids. The Collection of Regolith Experiment (CORE) addresses the unique challenge of collecting and analyzing material samples in microgravity.
University of Florida | Dr. Rob Ferl and Dr. Anna-Lisa Paul are adapting technology designed for the ISS to suborbital uses with their experiment, Validating Telemetric Imaging Hardware for Crew-Assisted and Crew-Autonomous Biological Imaging in Suborbital Applications. By recalibrating the way data is collected, the experiment will enable more biological research on suborbital missions.

BlueOrigin,"I recently went through the interview process with Blue - I spoke with who would be my manager on Friday where he clarified that they would be adjusting the position based on my experience. It was originally an Engineer II position, but I only have 4 years experience (they were asking for minimum of 5), so they are going to have to modify it to an Engineer I position. 

He said “don’t worry about the title right now, just have a number in your head that you expect for salary. Blue won’t do that for you, we want you to tell us what you want, and go from there.” 

I’ve never had this happen before, I’ve worked at TI and Raytheon where there is zero negotiation on salary. 

I ran the numbers on it, and to have the same standard of living in Seattle as I have now, I’d have to make 115k. I also would like to get a liiiitle bit of a bump, so I thought I’d ask for 118k. Does this sound reasonable?

My interpretation of this is that they want to move manufacturing of the machinery that makes our civilisation tick, but pollutes the world, to space, so things like steel production or even manufactured goods like cars, planes and ships. If that is the case, what is the plan for getting those goods back to earth from space? Re-entry is hard and I would have thought sending mega-tons of payload in through the atmosphere would generate a lot of heat, which could even go some way to offset the environmental gains.

Blue moon is nice but the cargo capacity is limited to about 4,500 kg to the lunar surface because the second stage has to send the mass of itself as well as the blue moon lander into LEO before TLI, therefore most of the fuel and ergo most of the payload capacity. However what if New Glenn's second stage was refueled in LEO? Has anyone here done the calcuations of how much mass could be thrown on TLI?

* BFR style ; Integrated seconds stage/payload faring with hatch style payload release mechanism and side mounted heat sheild. Along with adequite aero control surfaces for manuvering in the atomosphere. 

* Kistler/Early falcon 9 concept style ; Front mounted or possibly an inflatible heatsheild design on the front of the second stage.

* Horizontal landing style, Intergrated second stage &amp; spaceplane that delivers the payload to target orbit, re-enters the atomosphere, autonoumously flies back to a runway.

BlueOrigin,"I'm curious if Blue themselves will find the research and design for habitats or if they will be more apt to use a 3rd party. It seems from how we can see their progression with both rockets and now blue moon, that they will likely develop some early habitats first. Potentially they could use New Shepard's suborbital flights to gather data on micro gravity and see how their environmental systems hold up. Using this information they could develop smaller habitats and then look to build larger ones. With Bezo's plan for trillions in the solar system I would think that he would keep R&amp;D of space habitats in house. What is this subs opinion?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/9qq990/will_blue_origin_create_their_own_in_space/
BlueOrigin,"Currently the partially reusable New Glenn has a payload capacity of about 45 tonnes to LEO in the first iteration of it's operational design.
 As we've seen with the Falcon 9 however the payload capacity and overall power through Engine upgrades/ stretches of the launch vehicle itself have yielded a near doubling of initial payload capacity, for example Block I of falcon 9 had a fully expendable maximum payload to LEO of about 10 metric tonnes. (which likely would have been less than half of that if Space X had attempted partial re usability on block I) In only eight years we have seen Falcon 9's expendable payload capacity double to around 22 metric tonnes to LEO, with all this being said my question is this.
      Could we potentially see New Glenn's partially reusable payload capacity grow in a similar fashion in the years after it starts flying? Could it approach 90 metric tonnes to LEO and potentially compete with BFR before the advent of New Armstrong? 
What do you guys think?

They're in the same payload class, use the same engines (mostly), and have the two largest fairings on the market. The main difference seems to be in how each program is trying to address lowering cost. How do you think this will play out? I feel that baked into the design of each vehicle are very different assumptions as to what the future of the launch market will look like.

BlueOrigin," Hi There,  


Moving heavy industry from Earth into space is at the core of Blue Origin’s mission. The future will be better for our children – and our children’s children – if we use space to benefit life on Earth and enable millions of people to live and work in space.  
   
The next logical step in this path is a return to the Moon. To do this we need reusable access to the lunar surface and its resources. We’re in the conceptual design phase of a large lunar lander that will provide that access called Blue Moon.  
   
We are not alone in our drive to return to the Moon, and there have been some exciting updates this week at the 69th Annual International Astronautical Congress in Bremen, Germany.  
   
Blue has joined leading space companies and agencies to support the creation of [The Moon Race](https://blueorigin.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ca4c14684ac1af3f1219b4382&amp;id=7cef927497&amp;e=ea7008150c), a non-profit working to launch a competition for teams looking for a ride to the lunar surface. The goal is consistent with our aim to land large payloads on the Moon that can access and utilize the resources found there. We’re supporting this initiative, along with ESA, Airbus, and other entities seeking to foster the next generation of lunar exploration – with Blue Moon and New Glenn.  
   
We’re also excited to announce a collaboration with OHB SE and MT Aerospace on a [future Blue Moon mission](https://blueorigin.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ca4c14684ac1af3f1219b4382&amp;id=3a78b71971&amp;e=ea7008150c).

BlueOrigin,"I did some pixel-counting of the latest [New Glenn image here](https://i.imgur.com/C0wsvbr.png), and this is what I came up with: 

Old 3 stage New Glenn: 313 ft
Old 2 stage New Glenn: 270 ft
Latest version of New Glenn: 308 ft

Essentially, the booster is the same height and the second stage got a lot bigger. 

Old second stage: 36 ft
New Second stage: 53 ft

So basically, the new second stage has a volume 50% larger than the old second stage. Given that methalox is around 2.25 times as dense as hydrolox fuel, though, this represents much less fuel mass. However, hydrolox gives around 20% more ISP than methalox, and less fuel mass means the booster doesn't have as much to lift, so ends up producing a higher DeltaV. I'm not sure exactly what the overall performance change is, but I'd guess the new hydrolox second stage is probably similar in capability to the old methalox upper stage. So in all likelihood, despite the rocket getting larger, it hasn't dramatically changed in payload capabilities from the old 2-stage version.

BlueOrigin,"   For a company that's stated goal is to have ""Millions of people living and working in space,"" I am quite frankly amazed that We haven't heard so much peep about an actual crewed orbital craft that could start actually transporting people into LEO. Despite the current lack of information, there are three things that we do know for certain 

* New Glenn will have a Crew Vehicle. 
- The hostess of NS-8 on the Blue Origin Livestream mentioned that people who had flown on new Shepard would be given first priority for tickets aboard New Glenn's crew vehicle into orbital space.
* BO is targeting crewed New Glenn launches to start between 2025-2026.
- Rob Meyerson has previously stated that he thinks that New Glenn will begin orbital manned launches is about 7-8 years, While seemingly less ambitious than some of the timeframes that SpaceX has ascribed to their BFR, I think that this is a decidedly more realistic timeframe when you're orbital rocket hasn't even flown yet.

* Blue Origin did already design a Manned Orbit-class Crew Vehicle but it has most certainly changed radically from that initial design. 
- Back around 2011, BO submitted a Commercial Crew proposal to NASA that involved a small (Dragon V2, Cst-100 sized) Biconic Crew Vehicle that would be capable of carrying at most a crew of 7 into LEO, While this was their proposed crew vehicle at the time things have most certainly changed, at the time BO's First Orbital rocket was supposed to be similar in capacity to earlier iterations of Falcon 9 or the lesser powered configurations of the Atlas 5, Now BO is planning a Super-Heavy Lift (According to Robert Zubrin likely close to 60 metric tonnes to LEO with new dual Be-3u upper stage) launch vehicle as it's first Orbital Rocket with a 7m diameter to boot, so the design has most certainly been changed to accommodate these updated parameters. 

      I Personally Speculate that the design teams at BO will go one of three ways with their crew vehicle.

* Option 1 ; 7m Integrated upper stage crew vehicle (Similar to BFR)
- Vehicle would have a dry mass of about 30 metric tonnes, and would have it's crew cabin located on top with fuel tanks and engines located directly below along with a side mounted heat-shield and a lifting body re-entry profile, Whether or not BO would resurrect BE-4 vac or just decide to use the BE-3u engine is anybody's guess, but it would no doubt be a smart way to introduce a crew vehicle as well as full upper stage re-use at the same time on New Glenn, assuming that there would also be a cargo version (Again similar to BFR). Their are obvious downsides to this design decision though, Mostly stemming from the fact that the vehicle would need to carry it's heat-shield everywhere it went -which would cut into dry mass, not to mention the need to carry extra re-entry control surfaces as well as one or more sea-level engines for landing propulsively on the surface of the Earth. This vehicle could likely fly 20-30 people into orbit at once and at a lower cost that CST-100 or Dragon 2 (but not likely lower than BFR) since Full re-use would for sure make tourist/ Civilian seats to orbit far cheaper than if the second stage was expended at the end of every launch simply leaving a dead-weight capsule in orbit. If orbital re-fueling was implemented this vehicle could also be used on missions beyond LEO, to Lunar orbit or even to the Lunar surface if the vehicle uses Hydrolox, since it would likely need to re-fuel on the Lunar surface.  

* Option 2 ; 7m Biconic Crew capsule 
- Weighing about 20 metric tonnes, this vehicle would enable a crew of about 20-30 people to go into Orbit and would either propulsively land back on Earth or would land via parachutes and airbags like the New Shepard Capsule or CST-100. It would essentially be a scaled up version of what BO submitted to Nasa in 2011. Since it would be a dead weight payload, it would need to be connected to a in-space tug to go anywhere beyond LEO and the Second stage would have to be recovered by alternate means (say a front mounted heat-shield or a ballute), The main advantage of this vehicle over option 1 is that it would have significantly lower development costs and would be able to be operational sooner after development was initiated.

* Option 3 ; 5m 7-10 person Crew capsule
- Likely weighing less than 10 metric tonnes, this vehicle would not take as much of an advantage of economies of scale as the other two options nor would it be as ground breaking or innovative, but it would be easier to send onto TLI because of it's smaller mass and would likely be more adept for serving the near future crew transport market, ex. ISS replacement or bigelow Ba-330 derived private space stations. It would also be the cheapest option in terms of development cost, for a smaller vehicle it would require a tapered inter-stage since New Glenn has a main body diameter of 7 meters.      
               
    In the end this is just my estimation of what BO might do regarding a crew transport vehicle that will fly on New Glenn, What do you guys think? Comment below and let me know.

BlueOrigin,"SpaceX substantially improved the performance of Falcon 9 since first launching.  Do you think BO will do the same with NS by increasing the length of the fuel tanks or the power of the BE3?

Some sounding rockets go to altitudes of 1000 km or more, while the current NS goes to just over 100 km.  How much extra value would going to 1000 km offer?

At 1000 km, the earth would take up just 120 degrees of the view vs 160 degrees at 100 km.  That's 33% less - a lot more spacey feel.  Free fall would last 8 minutes longer.  What would that be worth to you?  How much more value would that be for a tourist visit to space?  Would it be enough for you to think, ""Wow, earth is small.  We better take care of this thing and war is just insanity?""

New Glenn will be a real launch vehicle, but it won't do anything to bring man to space.  It likely won't substantially beat Falcon 9 or Falcon H on price.  It's good for America and freedom loving people the world over to have redundancy, but it's not worthy of Bezos's ambitions.  

BFR is the only project in motion that will truly advance humanity towards space.  BO needs to get on the bandwagon.  And, truth be told, if BFR succeeds, every other launch vehicle will become antiquated.

This is Blue Origin's 2nd launch of 2018 and 9th launch in total of this suborbital New Shepard type booster and capsule hardware type. Similarly to the last flight of NS-2 last year, this launch will include a test of the escape motor in the crew capsule, unlike the last test of this type, this escape test will not be performed at maxQ but at a much higher altitude. Jeff Bezos mentioned via Twitter; ""We’ll be doing a high-altitude escape motor test — pushing the rocket to its limits,"". These are the final tests that need to be completed before the spacecraft is ready for passenger operation, space.com has noted ""If the test program continues to go well, New Shepard could begin operational flights as early as this year, Blue Origin representatives have said. The company has not publicly revealed how much it will charge for a seat aboard the suborbital vehicle.""

This is Blue Origin's 2nd launch of 2018 and 9th launch in total of this suborbital New Shepard type booster and capsule hardware type. Similarly to the last flight of NS-2 last year, this launch will include a test of the escape motor in the crew capsule, unlike the last test of this type, this escape test will not be performed at maxQ but at a much higher altitude. Jeff Bezos mentioned via Twitter; ""We’ll be doing a high-altitude escape motor test — pushing the rocket to its limits,"". These are the final tests that need to be completed before the spacecraft is ready for passenger operation, [space.com](https://space.com) has noted ""If the test program continues to go well, New Shepard could begin operational flights as early as this year, Blue Origin representatives have said. The company has not publicly revealed how much it will charge for a seat aboard the suborbital vehicle.""

BlueOrigin,"Trying to put together some thoughts I've been having for awhile:

I have a hunch that the future of Blue Origin will look like the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). AAP was the original plan for human spaceflight in the 1970s after the Apollo program met its initial goal of landing people on the moon. It was an ambitious program of space stations, large uncrewed platforms, and lunar base construction.  Some features:

-Saturn I for orbital transport, Saturn V for deep space transport
-Habitats derived from Saturn upper stages
-Uprating the Apollo CM to carry 6 astronauts for LEO missions
-Uprating the LEM to take all 3 astronauts to the lunar surface, stay for longer,  and/or act as a temporary base. 
-Cargo only version of the LEM
-converting the LEM ascent stage into a space telescope

It's obvious that one of the main design drivers behind AAP was a desire to reuse as much of the moon landing hardware as possible. NASA was aware even in the mid 60s that R&amp;D funding was going to tail off after Kennedy's goal was met so AAP was conceived as a way to have an ambitious human spaceflight program by leveraging existing investments. As we all know AAP was scrapped by Nixon in favor of the shuttle.

Blue has continuously said that their major focus is rockets. Bob Smith even goes so far as to say that they're a propulsion company at heart. We know that Bezos wants to develop at a minimum three launch vehicles; New Glenn, New Shepard, and New Armstrong, to lower the cost of accessing space. Each of these vehicles represents a significant investment in engines, in manufacturing, and in technical expertise. They are building a giant factory in Florida to support New Glenn and I imagine a similar investment will be made for New Armstrong. Their entire organization seems for the most part geared towards launch vehicles, rocket engines, and capsules.

I've always been skeptical that launch is all that is needed to develop space. Other necessary pieces of infrastructure would include landers, depots, habitats, and servicing craft. My hunch is that if Blue Origin decides to build any of this then commonality with the launch infrastructure is going to be a major design driver. You see this with Blue Moon which tries to utilize New Shepard technology to do a LEM sized lunar lander. If Blue decides to do habitats then they're going to be based off of New Glenn or New Armstrong tankage. Launch vehicles are one of the few space products that are sort of mass-produced whereas habitats, landers, and depots might be one offs for a while. It doesn't make sense to double the size of the company or build a new factory to produce a single habitat module when they can just tap off from the people and tooling they already have.

I could also be totally wrong. SpaceX is right now betting the farm on making breaks with the past. Red Dragon was supposed to be the quickest path to Mars but it has been scrapped in favor of going right for BFR. I've even read articles that for the money it cost to build and the number of years it will be operational (assuming BFR is flying by 2020's) that Falcon Heavy might not have been worth it. Adapting three Falcon-9's into a heavy lift launcher was much harder than it seems and that it might have just been quicker to move to a wider rocket from the start.

Bezos also has more money than God and could probably build his own habitats, depots, and landers from the ground up. ",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/8gchot/blue_origin_applications_program/
BlueOrigin,"What’s  the deal with Kent? Will they build parts of the New Glenn there and then ship it to Florida to assemble? If so, how will they do that?

* Has BO said anything about the design of this manned orbital Spacecraft that they plan on building?

* Assuming that it is rapidly re-usable do we expect this Spacecraft to be a separate Spacecraft or integrated with the newly announced duel Be-3u upper stage (Kind of like BFR) as a way of developing upper stage re-usability

* What kind of payload/passenger capacity could this 7m spacecraft have?

* Could it have orbital refueling Allowing it to perform TLI burns and send humans/ cargo into cislunar Space?

- If anyone has any information or better insights then I would like to hear it.

BlueOrigin,"Blue Origin plans to build the New Glenn from the ground up with reusability of the first stage through retropropulsive landing in mind.

They have some Grasshopper-like experience with New Shepherd, but given the massive size of New Glenn it might make sense for them to first test a scaled-down variant of the first stage (a la F9R Dev) with fewer than 7 BE-4s.

Are there any indications that Blue plans to use such a test vehicle before (or in parallel with) building the full-scale New Glenn?  If so, they'd likely test it sometime next year to keep the 2020 debut of NG.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/8drmwv/be4_grasshopperf9r_dev/

It is well known that the BE-4 engine is being developed in partnership with ULA. But what about the other techs? Are there any other companies collaborating with BO? I think that they develop most of the techs themselves, just like SpaceX, but maybe I’m wrong. I’ve also always been curious about how and where they get their materials and propellant.

BlueOrigin,"   I'm sure that most of the people who follow commercial spaceflight closely are aware that the overall architecture for New Glenn has changed pretty significantly in recent months. 


   Originally the plan for New Glenn was to have a vehicle boasting 3 engine types, a first stage powered by 7 Lox/LCH4 SL Be-4's, a second stage powered by a single Vac Be-4u and an optional thrid stage from GEO &amp; deep space mission that would be powered by a single or possibly multiple Lox/LH2 Be-3u's. As of recently that Architrcture has been radically simplified.   


Instead of using a Lox/LCH4 Be-4U second stage with a single engine  BO has switched to a duel engine Be-3u configuration which uses hydrogen instead of the originally propesed methane fuel. Per this change I was wondering if anyone had done the math to see how New Glenn's preformance has changed, the primary questions that come up in my mind are these.

1. Since Hydrolox is less dense than Metlox, how much has the second stage being stretched to accommodate the new fuel?

2. By how much and in which direction has LEO has LEO payload changed? Although I understand that thrust is now lower, hasn't the upper stage gained like 80s of Isp and not to mention become a lot lighter when fully loaded with fuel and oxidizer my own two cents tells me that LEO payload has increased but IDK for sure.

3. How much has GEO direct insertion payload changed, surely it's increased?

4. How does this affect Blue Origins long-term goals, Does this pivot to Hydrolox for the second stage mean that second stages will be re-used as lunar tugs? How does this affect Blue Origins manned ambitions? Lunar ISRU refueling?

5. How does this affect new Armstrong development, has new Glenn been simplified to allow New Armstrong development to follow sooner so as to compete with BFR?

BlueOrigin,"Hey all, so the ULA development plan is to first upgrade the Centuar from 3m to 5m for use on the Vulcan first stage. Then they will be adding the ACES kit, and then sometime after that SMART for the first stage. The last major item is the XEUS kit for 5m Centuar for all the obvious uses.

My question is given the close relationship with ULA and same fuel type being used on both the NG 3rd stage and the Centaur could we see BO license the ACES and XEUS tech for a BO space tug? 

If so I'd like to see the math on a 7m ACES and XEUS, if any of you are smart enough to math that out I'd appreciate it.

Thanks!",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/87knt4/7m_xeus/
BlueOrigin,"Intro 

* It has previously been stated by Rob Meyerson at Blue origin that they hope to be able to fly humans on New Glenn in ""7-8 years"". If this is true then Blue Origin must be looking to develop a manned capsule capable of transporting Humans to LEO and potentially further. Using what we know I think I have an idea for how initial manned Lunar missions facilitated by blue origin will work.

Step 1 (2024-2025) 

* Blue Origin will launch a number of commercial (probably Bigelow) habitats, radiators, solar panels to build a station at EML-1, after the station is complete it will serve as a joint between the LEO - EML-1 stage of the journey &amp; the EML-1-Lunar surface part of the journey. In addition to the modules, Blue origin will launch several Blue Moon landers to dock with the station so as to provide lunar surface access.

Step 2 (2026-2027) 

* Crew + cargo bound for the moon launch aboard a BO crew capsule into LEO, after the Orbit insertion stage separates the Capsule + New Glenn third stage remain in LEO and orbit a few times before doing a direct injection burn for the EML-1 station, After a few days of coasting the Crew arrive and transfer cargo into the Blue moon lander, where they undock from the station to set up an initial Lunar base with rudimentary ISRU capability. After their mission, they launch aboard the Blue Moon landers and Dock with the EML-1 station once more and transfer their extra hydrolox fuel to the Capsule + NG third stage stack which allows the crew to return to Earth. All subsequent New Glenn Third stages are reused and pick the NG capsule up form LEO and take it to EML-1 where the process is repeated for routine lunar surface access.

BlueOrigin,"So I've been writing a Sci-Fi novel slowly but steadily over the past 3 months or so and takes place in 2068. I have seen where the main character is describing the history of spaceflight and I know for sure that the race Between SpaceX's BFR (Flying since 2024) and Blue Origins New Armstrong (Flying since 2032) is going to be a huge part of this scene.

 Now I've described BFR in great detail in this scene, but to do it justice I would also like to describe New Armstrong is great detail as well, now before you accuse me of engaging in wild speculation I'd just like to say that this is all for fun and I'm not asking for some detailed figures such as TWR for the main engines or Isp, but rather the configuration and rough size of the vehicle.

 Part of me wants to make the fictionalized New Armstrong a Larger scale copycat of the BFR (I.e the, proverbial 747 &amp; a380 of early-mid 21st-century spaceflight) but the other part of me wants to make it something completely different form BFR in terms of how similar the architecture is to what SpaceX is developing.

BlueOrigin,"New Glenn is an amazing vehicle from what is being proposed, In a standard 2 stage configuration with re-using the first stage, it will be able to launch 45,000 kg into a 200 km x 200 km LEO.

 New Glenn also has a key advantage over the SpaceX Falcon series in it has a 7 m x 21 m payload fairing that is far less volume constrained and offers space for some amazing things like the large commercial moon landers, Space tugs, interplanetary probes, Bigelow ba330 habitats, etc. Now 45,000 kg is a lot (about what the Saturn V put on trans-lunar injection) But given the lesser concerns on volume, there are potentially even larger payloads (Airforce orbital weapons/ maybe some private space station parts) that would be in the super heavy class range.

 My question is there any way that the Be-3u hydrolox third stage could be used to allow New Glenn to loft even heavier payloads into LEO (similar to the Saturn V flight profile) while still reusing the first stage. If so then I would be very interested to see how much more than 45,000 kg New Glenn could loft (If anyone would do the math on this they would be a homie to me) and what some potential applications of this could be?

* Intended as a direct competitor to SpaceX's BFR for commercial cargo flights to lunar and Mars bases as well as the assembly of space stations in Earth orbit and launching entire satellite constellations all at once.
* 15 - 18-meter diameter
* stack height 100 + meters tall (squatter than new Glenn or BFR)
* Second stage ship with side mounted heatshield (similar to BFR) 6 - 8 methalox (Probably different from BE-4 or BE-2 vacuum engines) with both cargo only and crew only interior configurations.  
* 260-300 tonnes of LEO (Fully reusable)
* 75 + tonnes to GTO (direct insertion)
* 200 + passengers in crew configuration
* 300 - 400 tonnes to Mars (with orbital refueling and cargo loading)
* Launched from LC - 39D (completed by 2030)
* Booster preforms RTLS maneuvers and lands on the launch mount
* Operational by 2030 (7 or 8 years after announcement)

BlueOrigin,"This is an attempt to gather information about when New Shepard will fly next. Earlier in the year we were told New Shepard would have an unmanned test, then move to test pilots by the end of 2017 and have paying customers in 2018. I have been looking around for info about when the next New Shepard flight will be and this is what I have come up with so far. Feel more then welcome to add anything about the status of New Shepard.

BlueOrigin,"Hello /r/BlueOrigin!

I am a Brooke Owens Fellow Alumni, a Chemical Engineer Graduate from UCSD and a Propulsion Engineer at Virgin Orbit. This past summer, I participated in the Brooke Owens Fellowship Program which offers aerospace internships in engineering, policy, business analysis, venture capital, communications, education, airport operations and more to undergraduate women pursuing careers in the aerospace industry. In addition to internships at the industry's top companies, each Fellow is paired with TWO executive mentors in the aerospace industry, one within her company and one outside of her company. These mentors include two most recent Deputy Administrators of NASA, multiple CEOs, award-winning journalists, astronauts and more. My personal mentor was a veteran of five Space Shuttle flights and seven spacewalks named Scott Parazynski (we are friends on Facebook now!!!!). On top of that, I met 36 intelligent women who shared the same passion as mine: Space.

This fellowship was the best outlet for the aerospace industry and endless opportunities. So please spread the word to benefit other women!
 
The application information can be found on the Brooke Owens Fellowship website. Applications are due December 5th!

This is going to be Blue Origin's first launch with a brand new engine and new fuel, very different flight path and flight characteristics and WAY more thrust.  I think there are good engineers working hard on this rocket however it IS rocket science, something is bound to go wrong with all that new hardware.


Also I didn't see any cold gas thrusters in the launch concept video which are pretty much essential if you want to turn the booster around at 120ish km like SpaceX have been doing. Fins just aren't going to cut it up there.
Also could a booster that size land on such flimsy landing legs?

BlueOrigin,"[New Glenn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEhohh6eYk&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I promised a revised analysis a while back and only just now getting around to posting it.  

[This version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhbaivoynsw160q/NG%20Design%20Round%202.xlsx?dl=0) has the same basic assumptions as the previous post [(found here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/60llhq/new_glenn_mass_estimates_based_on_payload_to/). Given the limited information available on the New Glenn and BE-4 I had to use some of the basic equations and some external sources ([Braeunig.us](http://braeunig.us/space/index.htm) is a great resource for simple stuff like this) to find a rocket design that closely matches the published measurements.

I limited the T/W range to a much smaller series (1.25-1.37) and that seems to agree within 6m of the height estimates of 82m for the two stage and 95m for the three stage configurations, so I am declaring victory! I also used hemispherical dome volumes on the tanks which I believe is the reason I actually achieved the height estimates for the given payload mass.

Tab {2.4} TW=1.25, actually matches height within 0.8m and 0.2m of the two and three stage versions, respectively. Worth checking out.

Comments, questions, fears, and are welcome.

Enjoy!

[edit] Fogot something of note, if my stage masses are accurate (mostly the hydrolox S3) then a single NG launch is capable of boosting the Orion to TLI. IMO that is a brilliant strategy, allow yourself to back up SLS and it gives you an in with NASA and certain Congress critters who may be persuaded to fund some development/missions for a Blue Moon lander

BlueOrigin,"Hi guys, I just watched the New Glenn introduction video and  got quite hyped, a very sleek looking rocket with an interesting take on reusability and commercial space flight.
Nevertheless, I got some questions:

1) Why did Blue Origin choose to land New Glenn just like New Shepard, with a Burn-to-hover and a subsequent landing instead of landing directly without a hover burn?
Isn't that inefficient? I would guess maybe with a hover the landing can be more precise?

2)Is there more data for BO rockets in general and New Glenn in particular? As an engineering student, I dig them datasheets.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/6lkbz2/new_glenn_questions/

BlueOrigin,"Review: https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blue-origin-logo.jpg

So in the above image we see 5 arcs which we know the first 2 map to:
3.6 km/s  = Reusable suborbital rocket system named New Shepard.
9.5 km/s = Reusable LEO/GEO orbital rocket system named New Glenn.

The next 2 here are logical assumptions: 
13 km/s = Reusable Cis-lunar rocket named New Armstrong.
19 km/s = Reusable Mars/Asteroid belt scale rocket named TBD. (I assume we will know this name in the next decade)

And my wild guess: 
20 km/s = Reusable intraplanetary spaceship system named TBD 

The reason I assume the 5th vehicle will not be a rocket is because the delta-v is only 1km/s more. This implies a radically different type of vehicle with slightly more delta-v. Robert Heinlein says 10km/s is ""halfway to anywhere"".  Well that means 20 km/s from LEO is therefore ""anywhere and back"".  See:
https://i.imgur.com/SqdzxzF.png
And visualized a better way:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/ebf6D.png
This vehicle will not land on the surface of hard bodies, it will be a true spaceship which is built in space and refueled there. This will be the minimally viable ""trans oceanic"" cargo vehicle of the solar system.
Basically it will fly along the ""tops"" of the gravity wells in the above image. 

My baseline ""spaceship"" is something like this:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus-X
I assume Jeff will do something much larger and interesting. 
Anyone care to take a stab at size/capabilities of rockets 3 and 4, and spaceship 5?

Thanks!

BlueOrigin,"I get the feeling that the internet in general (and reddit) believes that SpaceX's ITS is a much surer bet and will fly much sooner than any comparable BO rocket (such as New Armstrong), but I'm of the opposite opinion. While I *really* hope both of these projects are successful, I do think BO has some major advantages in resources and scheduling, given the present situation. 

&amp;nbsp;

We all know a great many things will be required for SpaceX's ITS and BO's New Armstrong, but in my view the big ones are:

&amp;nbsp;

*1. Lots of money for development*. In this respect, BO is in much better shape, as they have all the money they need thanks to Bezos, while SpaceX does not have the same level of resources. 

&amp;nbsp;

*2. R&amp;D*. It seems likely that new Armstrong will be cheaper, faster, and less complicated to build than ITS (with much less R&amp;D), as it will probably be a scaled-up version of New Glenn (same engines, similar general design). ITS, on the other hand, is a good deal more complex and ambitious while also being quite different from Falcon 9/Heavy. 

&amp;nbsp;

*3. An entirely new factory, built either at the launch location, or on the coast* (due to booster diameter preventing movement by road). BO will have a factory meeting these requirements soon (albeit not tooled for New Armstrong, but certainly capable of it), while SpaceX doesn't even have plans for a facility like this yet.

&amp;nbsp;

I think once New Glenn is flying around 2020 ([per Jeff Bezos](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/blue-origin-releases-details-of-its-monster-orbital-rocket/)), New Armstrong will be a short step forward for BO. They'll have the funds, the factory space, and most of the R&amp;D done. If we give them a generous three years to hammer out New Glenn booster landings and get the final iteration of the New Glenn design done, by 2023 or so they'll probably have the data to start New Armstrong construction, and be flying around 2025. 

&amp;nbsp;

SpaceX's ITS schedule is much harder to quantify. I believe Elon himself mentioned ITS construction might take a decade or so at the current rate, which seems like a fairly realistic number. While SpaceX is working hard to get the R&amp;D out of the way, they don't have the money right now to start building/acquiring the factory facilities required for ITS, and they can't use the ones they already have. They're working on getting the money, but in order to do so they have to focus on getting commercial operations rolling, and that's been somewhat slower than they originally forecast. Once SpaceX actually starts executing on a plan to acquire ITS factory space, I think we're around 4 years out from ITS booster flights, and 5 years out from ITS flights. But that's the key. Until we hear more about actual ITS factory space, ITS is just a paper rocket (albeit backed up by more and more data and R&amp;D as time goes on). 

&amp;nbsp;

On the other hand, BO has been moving dirt for awhile, and will soon have a setup capable of bending metal for New Armstrong (minus some tooling, although I expect a lot of commonality between New Glenn and New Armstrong). Consequently, if I had to bet on one of these rockets, I would place a much higher probability on New Armstrong eventually launching than ITS, and probably sooner (by at least a year or two). 

&amp;nbsp;

Another thing that would be interesting to quantify is how much SpaceX's schedule delays are affected by their very high employee turnover rate. In my experience, high turnover tends to lead to project delays due to lack of continuity and experience. BO appears to have much lower turnover than SpaceX, and seems to be generally well-liked as a career company (as opposed to SpaceX, which has bad long-term employee retention rates). This may reduce BO's risk of project delays. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, does this analysis seem accurate? In what ways do you agree or disagree?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/6b0hnr/is_bos_new_armstrong_more_likely_to_eventually/

What about health care? Are premiums/deductibles/copays reasonable for a family? Are there any retirement incentives available (401k matching, stock options, etc)?

Any idea of what I should expect for salary? I'm currently making ~$120k/year. Is it reasonable to expect at least the same at Blue Origin in an Industrial Engineering type of role? Are most new hires from a referral or is it easy to make it through without one?

BlueOrigin,"[New Glenn](https://youtu.be/BTEhohh6eYk)

[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8mzqw6disijbfyc/NG%20Design.xlsx?dl=0) are my initial estimations for the New Glenn launch mass and potential as a vehicle for exploration. I want to start this discussion on the /r/BlueOrigin community, I hope to update some of this in the coming months as more information becomes available. 


Let me start by saying the only guarantee I can make is these numbers WILL be wrong. The known parameters used to arrive at these estimations are: 

(1) Sea level thrust of the BE-4

(2) Number of engines in S1 and S2

(3) Chamber pressure of the BE-4

(4) (Old) comments by Bezos on the thrust and Isp for the BE-3U

(5) Payload to LEO and GTO for the 2 Stage configuration

(6) Landing technique and some comparison data from the F9 gathered on /r/spacex

(7) A slide rule, and some good old armchair rocket science (okay maybe not the slide rule)


I did not attempt to estimate the mass of those “Stingray Strakes” on the S1, I did use the video to estimate the wing area assuming a 7m diameter core I got roughly 35m^2 which is roughly equivalent to the wing area of an F/A-18. I generally have preferred the 1,300mt for this analysis, it yields a higher T/W ratio for the 2 stage variant which allows for a faster burning of the S1 propellant (better for landing maneuvers) and still has enough payload margin to launch a relatively large (nearly S-IVb class) hydrolox S3 with little determent to the performance of the lower stages. In this configuration, the 350mt S2 easily allows for S1 recovery with sufficient landing propellant margin and still meet the quoted 45mt to LEO, 13mt to GTO numbers. As with others I had some trouble with getting the length figured out, I am beginning to wonder if the 7m diameter is referring to the engine base diameter and the tank diameter is actually ~6m, even that doesn't solve the problem though.




-*Tab {1}* outlines the engine performance numbers used in the analysis

-*Tabs {2}* outline the total vehicle performance with payload to LEO and GTO for different launch mass estimates (labelled based on the T/W at launch) 

-*Tab {3}* allows **YOU** to mess with the launch mass number and find your own optimization points for the two stage variant from the engine specs page and the stage mass variants

-*Tabs {4}* outline the general performance for the 3 stage variant based on the 1,300mt vehicle outlined in Tab {2}. Tab {3} is further divided into two different S3 masses (85mt, and 100mt). Interestingly enough if you just require the S3 to perform the TLI burn and use onboard payload propulsion to perform LOI you can lift 30mt direct to TLI, space station modules, Orion and landers are all within reach

-*Tab {5}* IMHO is the most important of all this, it outlines the potential for the NG to launch substantial propellant loads to LEO for mating with heavy loads already in orbit and launch them to important destinations like the moon, mars or gas giants in as little at **TWO** launches.




I surmise (even prior to NG announcement) that vehicles capable of 40-50mt to LEO are the minimum required to begin large scale exploration, colonization and expansion into space. For many reasons these vehicles are more than capable of carrying average commercial payloads for revenue to cover much of the infrastructure costs, they have sufficient mass to make them durable and capable of reuse and they have margins necessary to provide large propellant deliveries to LEO. Under the analysis performed NG shows an excellent capacity for enabling both heavy deep space launches and normal LEO services.


Let me know what you think, opinions and recommendations are encouraged. Anyone is welcome to use this for other work just add my name in there somewhere

**TL;DR** Two stage New Glenn has a 1,300t launch mass (sans payload) and is capable of lifting 45mt to LEO, 13mt to GTO. With the addition of a large hydrolox S3 (~100mt) it is capable of lifting 15mt directly to low lunar orbit and back to earth return trajectory in a single launch. Using a two stage to launch a 45t to LEO and a 3 stage to launch the S3 (no payload) you can directly place 45mt into low lunar orbit.

BlueOrigin,"Another mailing list update from Blue Origin: 

&gt; Although the BE-4 turbopump is smaller than your refrigerator, it generates 70,000 horsepower from a turbine running at nearly 19,000 revolutions per minute that pumps cryogenic propellants to pressures just under 5,000 pounds per square inch. To react the forces generated by the rotating turbine and impellers inside the pump, production rocket turbopumps to date have used traditional ball and roller bearings. For BE-4, we’re doing something different – we’re using hydrostatic bearings.

&gt; A hydrostatic bearing relies on a fluid film supplied by a high-pressure source to provide support for the shaft and cause it to float without contacting the static structure except at startup and shutdown. The BE-4 main turbopump uses hydrostatic journal bearings for radial support and hydrostatic axial bearings to carry axial thrust. The system is bootstrapped. The high pressure fluid films for the bearings are supplied by the propellants themselves – liquefied natural gas and liquid oxygen – tapped off from the pump discharge flows.

&gt; Material selection is a critical consideration for this approach, as there is physical contact between the bearing surfaces during the start transient before the fluid film is fully established and during the shutdown transient as the fluid film dissipates. With lab-scale tests and full-scale bearing rig tests using actual pump hardware, we evaluated over 20 material combinations in over a hundred tests, leading to our baseline material and coating choices.

&gt; Extensive rotordynamic and computational fluid dynamics analyses have shown the feasibility of this design, and recent powerpack tests confirmed that this approach works during the startup and shutdown transients – the most critical phases. The shaft orbit plot below shows that the turbopump lifts off smoothly and centers during a typical start transient, demonstrating a smooth ride on a film of propellant.

&gt; Why do we go to all this trouble instead of just using traditional bearings? Engine life. We’re relentlessly focused on reusability, and properly designed hydrostatic bearings offer the potential for longer engine life without refurbishment. This is one of the many engineering decisions we’ve made that we hope will lead to reusability – not just in principle – but to practical, operational reusability. If “reusability” requires significant refurbishment, inspection, and re-validation between flights, then it simply won’t lead to the far lower launch costs we need to achieve our vision of millions of people living and working in space.

&gt; We’ll keep you up to date as our testing progresses in the coming weeks.

BlueOrigin,"I've seen a lot of people putting New Glenn between Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy in terms of payload mass capability. This was my initial thought, but it turns out that the [Falcon Heavy 54,400 kg lift](http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities) capacity is for expendable launches. According to Musk, [the reusable mode Falcon Heavy will have 30-40% less lift capacity](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/726559990480150528) which puts the payload mass to LEO between 32,640 kg to 38,080 kg. The New Glenn, which will have 45,000 kg to LEO for reusable launches, can therefore **deliver about 18% to 38% more payload to LEO than FH**.

I don't think that NG will be offered as an expendable rocket, but if it were, using the 30%-40% ratio, NG would be able to launch 64,285 kg to 75,000kg to LEO. My guess would be that the true number is closer to the lower end since it looks like NG is not really designed to fly as expendable, for example the Falcon rocket family can fly without legs and gridfins but NG has integrated legs and would likely not remove the strakes and actuated fins.

Doing the same calculation for GTO, NG is slightly below Delta IV but much higher than FH**. Also keep in mind that this is the two stage variant of NG and the three stage will likely have extremely high performance for GTO compared to similar launch vehicles. Those are numbers that have not been released.

To summarize:



 | Delta IV Heavy | Falcon Heavy (reusable) | New Glenn (reusable, 2 stage variant | Falcon Heavy (expendable) | New Glenn (expendable, two stage variant)
---|---|----|----|----|----
Mass to LEO (kg) | 28,790 | 32,640 - 38,080 | 45,000 | 54,400 | 64,285 - 75,000
Mass to GTO (kg)| 14,220 | 8,000**| 13,000 | 22,200 | 18,570 - 21,670 

**As far as the FH, I'm not sure what the exact mass to GTO is for reusable launches. The SpaceX site says 8.0 mT for ""Standard Payment Plan"" so I assume this is the reusable mode. If we do the calculation based on 30% to 40% reduction, the mass to GTO would be  13,320 kg to 15,540 kg.


Down the road, purchasing an expendable FH would only make sense for payloads between 45,000kg and 54,000 kg (unless expendable FH is cheaper than reusable NG which is unlikely). Even then, three stage variant of NG would likely be a better option given the much larger fairing volume and a much cheaper (my personal prediction) launch cost since NG will still be reusable and does not involve parallel staging.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/5ygtaa/new_glenn_payload_mass_to_leo_is_18_38_greater/

BlueOrigin,"&gt;Robert Goddard’s first rockets used compressed gas to force the liquid propellants into the engine thrust chambers. While simple in design and a logical starting point, he quickly realized the limitations with this approach: it requires thick-walled heavy propellant tanks and limits the engine’s chamber pressure and performance, both of which limit payload capacity. The answer was turbopumps. Store the propellants in low-pressure light tanks, and then pump the propellants up to high pressure just ahead of injection into the main chamber.

&gt;For even more performance, you can add one or more boost pumps ahead of the main pumps. We’ve done that on the oxidizer side of our BE-4 engine. Our Ox Boost Pump (OBP) design leverages 3-D additive manufacturing to make many of the key components. The housing is a single printed aluminum part and all of the stages of the hydraulic turbine are printed from Monel, a nickel alloy. This manufacturing approach allows the integration of complex internal flow passages in the housing that would be much more difficult to make using conventional methods. The turbine nozzles and rotors are also 3-D printed and require minimum machining to achieve the required fits.

&gt;The OBP was first demonstrated last year in testing, where we validated its interaction with a main pump. The second iteration of the OBP for BE-4 is now in test. We’ve also just finished assembly of the unit that we’ll install for the first all-up BE-4 engine test.

&gt;We’ll keep you posted on how our BE-4 powerpack and engine testing progresses.

The question is: Since there are no pilots, who will the first passenger(s) be? The answer is: We don't know. Therefore we will have to speculate. And since Richard Branson wants to be one of the first passengers on Virgin Galactic's 'Unity' spacecraft, is it safe to assume that Jeff Bezos will want to be the first Blue Origin passenger?

BlueOrigin,"I'm struggling to understand the benefits of using New Shepard as a Space Tourism vehicle in Blue Origin's stated goal of advancing spaceflight. I don't see how it's a profitable endeavor. 

If we assume Blue Origin is going to sell tickets at $250,000, like Virgin Galatic, you'd have to launch ~75X in a year to generate the same revenue of 1 orbital flight. 

Since NS' capsule carries 6 people, you can figure they'll sell 5 of those seats. You'd want at least 1 employee on board to ensure everything is proceeding safely and the passengers are behaving. 

That gives you a revenue of $1.25M per flight.

The going rate for an orbital flight these days is between $80M and $120M depending upon services.

I see them losing money on NS tourism but gaining experience. I see this as helping to fund their institutional knowledge as they learn how to have a high launch cadence. I see this as them learning how to carry passengers safely. If they can put a few million in their pocket while they are learning, great. But, I don't see this as a long-term profitable endeavor. 

They can gain all the same knowledge as they work to recover New Glenn from the first few launches. 

Am I off here? It just seems to me that there are way easier ways to earn $100M than doing ~75 successful flights. It seems to me that there are easier ways to learn how to recover an orbital class first stage than doing 75 sub-orbital hops.

BlueOrigin,"I thought [multiple engine types multiplied costs](http://www.airspacemag.com/space/is-spacex-changing-the-rocket-equation-132285884/)?
&gt;Musk says that overhead starts with how the launch vehicle is designed. The workhorse Atlas V, for example, used for everything from planetary probes to spy satellites, employs up to three kinds of rockets, each tailored to a specific phase of flight. The Russian-built RD-180 first- stage engines burn a highly refined form of kerosene called RP1. Optional solid-fuel strap-on boosters can provide additional thrust at liftoff, and a liquid hydrogen upper stage takes over in the final phase of flight. Using three kinds of rockets in the same vehicle may optimize its performance, but at a price: “To a first-order approximation, you’ve just tripled your factory costs and all your operational costs,” says Musk.

&gt;Instead, from the very beginning, SpaceX designed its Falcon rockets with commonality in mind. Both of Falcon 9’s stages are powered by RP1 and liquid oxygen, so only one type of engine is required.

Also, there's this. Unless New Glenn will have a reusable third stage, there might be a problem of [the rocket being less cost-optimized for reusability](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/20qjvz/former_arianespace_chief_says_spacex_has/cg67rq6/).

&gt;Because for these rockets [i.e. Atlas V] the first stage is the cheapest part, most of the cost of the vehicle is in the upper stages since they use LOX/LH2, advanced materials, advanced engines, and so on. The RL-10 engine, for example, which is used on both the Delta and Atlas, costs nearly $40 million alone*. Even if the 1st stage of the Delta IV or Atlas 5 is provided for free from a magic leprechaun the cost of the rocket isn't going to get lower than the cost of the RL-10 plus the rest of the 2nd stage construction. Making the cheapest part of the vehicle cheaper just don't help overall cost of the rocket.

~~*while an expendable Falcon 9 v1.2 is $60 million for about twice the payload of an Atlas V 401~~

edit: you get the idea, $40 million is a significant fraction of the cost of a Falcon 9 launch.

It's good that the ""commonality"" philosophy is being applied with the two-stage version of the New Glenn (methane/liquid oxygen BE-4 engine used on both stages), and a third hydrolox stage *does* indeed have advantages for sending payloads on high-energy trajectories beyond Earth orbit. But is it worth it when you have the risk that comes with additional separation events, as well as more manufacturing and operational costs, and potentially less cost savings during reuse unless all stages turn out to be reusable? And recovering three stages would be a pain operationally if the launch market got to the point where rapid reusability is needed.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/5hf3by/about_new_glenns_hydrolox_third_stage/

BlueOrigin,"You've probably seen [my post asking if anyone had been to a Blue Origin launch before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/55rhig/anyone_here_ever_watched_a_blue_origin_launch/)  Well, thanks to the great feedback from /u/SPACEVINE, a cool boss that let me take a day off with little notice, and a supporting spouse, I was able to view today's launch in person.

I originally started out with a rambling, stream of consciousness telling of my experience.  For the sake of brevity, I decided instead to break it down into a couple of things.  The 'mechanics' of watching a Blue launch and the experience.

Prior to space vine's info I had found nothing about watching a Blue launch.  The company doesn't say anything about it, and it still such a small, new company not many people come out.  Van Horn is pretty middle-of-nowhere West Texas.  Most of the people there were from neighboring communities, maybe 2 hours away at most.  Once you get off I-10 in Van Horn there's a well maintained state highway that heads north.  After about 15 minutes or so of zooming around mountains and up and down hills you come around the bend and see the valley were Blue does the launches.  The VPF was easily seen off in the distance.  As I got closer you'd start to see 1 or two cars pulled off here and there on the side of the road.  I ended up parking near the main gate.  There's a decent sized gravel pull-off on the side that fit probably 10-20 cars.  I was told that if you went much further up the road you'd encounter the Sheriff.   The road wasn't closed but they were telling people that beyond that point they couldn't stop on the side of the road for some number of miles.  I had a cheap pair of 10X50 binos I had bought on the way down.  You could easily see the rocket and launchpad.  The landing pad was a bit further north and I had to strain a bit to see the landed rocket, but it's doable.  The people that showed up were friendly and from a wide variety of ages/backgrounds.  It was pretty informal.  Someone (Blue?  TXDOT?) had obviously put in that gravel pullout, but otherwise the whole thing seemed pretty hands off.  Blue's there to do its thing, and hey if you want to watch, good luck, you're basically on your own.  Also for most of the ride I had no cell signal with Verizon, but it sounded like a couple of people had a decent connection, so YMMV.

Now the experience.  If you haven't seen a launch, I highly recommend it.  Seeing it on video is one thing, but feeling the thunderous sound of the rocket (even a 'small' one like NS) is quite the experience.  Same with the sonic boom from the rocket just as it landed on the pad in the distance.  The sense of scale afforded by being there in person provides perspective.  Seeing the rocket fall in video is one thing, watching is screaming out of the heavens at some ungodly speed with your own eyes is quite another.

All in all, I'd say it was worth the drive (how much, depends on you) and would recommend it to anyone.  I'm guessing as things ramp up it might be busier/crazier out there, so if you are able I'd say go to one sooner than later.

One of the people at the spot I parked was dating someone at Blue.  One of the more interesting things they shared it it sounded like there was very little refurb of the vehicle between launches.  It sounded like they basically patch up the TPS on the bottom, as needed, and it's pretty much ready to go again.  (I'd love to see one where they launch 2-3 times in a day).  It sounded like they'll start flying people in the next year, and there's an internal lottery amongst employees about who gets to go on some of those first test launches.  When I asked if they had heard anything about BE-4, I was told they're aiming for January, but I don't know how old their info is.

If anyone has any questions, I'll try and answer them. I wanted to experience the launch, not be distracted by recording/photographing it.  But I did take some pics.  I'll post some later, if any are decent.

UPDATE:  [Posted an album online](http://imgur.com/a/D6tXv)  Keep the following things in mind:  I'm not a pro photographer.  Any pics taken during launch were basically me slamming down my binoculars and snapping a few quick shots, then watching the launch again.   I purposefully didn't edit/crop most of the pics, so you'd have a sense of perspective and get a feel for what it was like to watch it in person (should you decide too). My binos were able to get in a bit closer than my 200mm zoom, but you get the idea of what it looks like to see it in person from a distance...",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/563x7o/my_experience_of_watching_a_blue_origin_launch_in/

BlueOrigin,"I was considering driving a few hours out to Van Horn to see the launch on ~~Thursday~~ Wednesday. However, information about public viewing of launches is non-existent, especially compared to other established launch sites.  Before I potentially wasted my time I was hoping someone might have had experience so I know its a ""Oh yeah, you can see it off in the distance from the side of the road..."" or a ""No good, they close off the highway 20 miles in either direction"" kind of thing.  I've never seen a launch so I'm excited at the possibility, and I figured if you get a chance to see a rocket launch, what better than one where it's expected to blow up at some point.  I'm also dropping a note to BO, but I don't know if they'll get back to me in time.

UPDATE:  I decided to roll the dice.  After many hours of late, late night driving I'm in the area.  Much to my surprise and disappointment when I went to get a feel for the rest of the drive in the morning to the area near the launch site I now notice a note on Google Maps saying the road is closed, and pretty well before the area I had intended to drive to to view the launch = \  The Texas DOT site lists no road closures in the county...  I guess we'll see what happens in the morning, but I hope to see at least *something*.

This is Blue Origin's 4th Launch this year and 5th launch of this suborbital New Shepard booster and capsule hardware. This vehicle has flown and landed successfully in Nov 2015, Jan 2016, Apr 2016 and Jun 2016. This thread is an open discussion of any information you want to post about the live webcast coverage.

**Launch Mission:**

&gt;We’ll be doing our in-flight escape test with the same reusable New Shepard booster that we’ve already flown four times. About 45 seconds after liftoff at about 16,000 feet, we’ll intentionally command escape. Redundant separation systems will sever the crew capsule from the booster at the same time we ignite the escape motor. You can get an idea of what will happen in this [animation](https://youtu.be/N5i-f-D_A-M). The escape motor will vector thrust to steer the capsule to the side, out of the booster’s path. The high acceleration portion of the escape lasts less than two seconds, but by then the capsule will be hundreds of feet away and diverging quickly. It will traverse twice through transonic velocities – the most difficult control region – during the acceleration burn and subsequent deceleration. The capsule will then coast, stabilized by reaction control thrusters, until it starts descending. Its three drogue parachutes will deploy near the top of its flight path, followed shortly thereafter by main parachutes.

TL;DR: At approx T+45s and 16,000ft an anomoly signal will be sent and the capsule will be jettisoned. A solid motor will be triggered and will push the capsule away from the booster at great speed.


**The Booster:**

* Due to the nature of the test it is unlikely the booster will survive, which is why we're not going to do landing bingo. Sorry.

&gt;This test will probably destroy the booster. The booster was never designed to survive an in-flight escape. The capsule escape motor will slam the booster with 70,000 pounds of off-axis force delivered by searing hot exhaust. The aerodynamic shape of the vehicle quickly changes from leading with the capsule to leading with the ring fin, and this all happens at maximum dynamic pressure. Nevertheless, the booster is very robust and our Monte Carlo simulations show there’s some chance we can fly through these disturbances and recover the booster.

* Remember things don't always go to plan, space is hard so (unplanned) failures are possible or as Jeff put it on the last flight:

&gt;As always, this is a development test flight and anything can happen.

**How Can I Watch?**

**Where?**

This year the IAC is being held at Guadalajara, Mexico.

**What is IAC?**

&gt; Every year, the International Astronautical Federation together with the International Academy of Astronautics and theInternational Institute of Space Law (IISL), holds the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) which is hosted by one of the national society members of the IAF.

&gt; They are an annual meeting of the actors in the discipline of space, and are generally held in late September or early October. They consist of plenary sessions, lectures and meetings. The IAC is attended by the agency heads and senior executives of the world's space agencies.

Ok we're not going to pretend this speech isn't being a little over-shadowed by Spacex's mars announcement, ([which can be followed on their sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/54itnx/rspacex_mars_architecture_announcementiac_2016/)) but don't be too hasty in thinking that Blue Origin don't have anything too major up their sleeve.

I believe the naming system is based on the furthest location a human passenger could go. So while the ""New Glenn"" could send robots to other locations it will be limited to only sending humans to LEO. This makes the ""New Armstrong"" the human lunar development rocket. 

According to my eyes the road map says: 
3 km/s = New Shepard, 
9.5 km/s = New Glenn, 
15 km/s =  New Armstrong, 
19 km/s = ???, 
20 km/s = ???, 

Using some delta V maps (please link your favorite) Ceres looks about 19 km/s away. 
The mystery is why is the 2nd unknown rocket has only a 1 km/s improvement? 
I think it is because the first 4 will be designed to launch from Earth where the 4th represents an end state ""in space only"" transportation system in line with the following quote: 

""When it comes to space, I see it as my job, I'm building infrastructure the hard way. I'm using my resources to put in place heavy lifting infrastructure so the next generation of people can have a dynamic, entrepreneurial explosion into space.""

If you are going to have millions of people living and working in space I think this represents the ship which will fly between the infrastructure, most importantly fuel depots refueled from the ice in the asteroid belt.

BlueOrigin,"If Robert Zubrin's [comment is to be believed](https://twitter.com/robert_zubrin/status/775365975034114049), New Glenn should have an expendable payload to LEO of about 70 tonnes. While I'd expect it to be used in reusable mode most of the time, what payloads would justify using a rocket that big in fully expendable mode?

Here are two that I could think of:

1. Launching Europa Clipper to Jupiter. An Atlas 5 launch would take take 6 years to get to Jupiter. SLS could get the probe to Jupiter in less than 2 years using a higher energy direct transfer orbit. Is there an orbit available that would allow you to split the difference, and direct launch to Jupiter a bit slower than SLS, but without the multiple flybys a smaller Altas-V class of launcher would need?
2. The smallest version of the Bigalow 2100 station was guesstimated by Bigalow to mass in at about 70 tonnes. This is right at the limit of what NG would be capable of, but if it were possible I think this would be worthy of an expendable flight!

Can you think of any other missions that would warrant an expendable launch?

BlueOrigin,"&gt;Our next flight is going to be dramatic, no matter how it ends.

&gt;Like Mercury, Apollo, and Soyuz, New Shepard has an escape system that can quickly propel the crew capsule to safety if a problem is detected with the booster. Our escape system, however, is configured differently from those earlier designs. They mounted the escape motor on a tower above the capsule – a “tractor” configuration – the escape motor would pull the capsule away from a failing booster. But because a capsule cannot reenter Earth’s atmosphere or deploy parachutes with a tower on top, the tower, along with the escape motor, must be jettisoned on every flight – even the nominal flights. Expending an escape motor on every flight drives up costs significantly. Further, the jettison operation is itself safety critical. Failure to jettison the tower is catastrophic.

&gt;The New Shepard escape motor pushes rather than pulls and is mounted underneath the capsule rather than on a tower. There is no jettison operation. On a nominal mission, the escape motor is not expended and can be flown again and again. We’ve already tested our pusher escape system, including many ground tests and a successful [pad escape test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l8aQ3hQyVs), but this upcoming flight will be our toughest test yet. We’ll intentionally trigger an escape in flight and at the most stressing condition: maximum dynamic pressure through transonic velocities.

&gt;Capsule in-flight escape testing was last done during the Apollo program. From 1964-1966, in-flight escape tests were performed with Apollo simulator capsules using an expendable booster called the [Little Joe II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqeJzItldSQ). We’ll be doing our in-flight escape test with the same reusable New Shepard booster that we’ve already flown four times. About 45 seconds after liftoff at about 16,000 feet, we’ll intentionally command escape. Redundant separation systems will sever the crew capsule from the booster at the same time we ignite the escape motor. You can get an idea of what will happen in this [animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5i-f-D_A-M). The escape motor will vector thrust to steer the capsule to the side, out of the booster’s path. The high acceleration portion of the escape lasts less than two seconds, but by then the capsule will be hundreds of feet away and diverging quickly. It will traverse twice through transonic velocities – the most difficult control region – during the acceleration burn and subsequent deceleration. The capsule will then coast, stabilized by reaction control thrusters, until it starts descending. Its three drogue parachutes will deploy near the top of its flight path, followed shortly thereafter by main parachutes.

&gt;What of the booster? It’s the first ever rocket booster to fly above the Karman line into space and then land vertically upon the Earth. And it’s done so multiple times. We’d really like to retire it after this test and put it in a museum. Sadly, that’s not likely. This test will probably destroy the booster. The booster was never designed to survive an in-flight escape. The capsule escape motor will slam the booster with 70,000 pounds of off-axis force delivered by searing hot exhaust. The aerodynamic shape of the vehicle quickly changes from leading with the capsule to leading with the ring fin, and this all happens at maximum dynamic pressure. Nevertheless, the booster is very robust and our Monte Carlo simulations show there’s some chance we can fly through these disturbances and recover the booster. If the booster does manage to survive this flight – its fifth – we will in fact reward it for its service with a retirement party and put it in a museum. In the more likely event that we end up sacrificing the booster in service of this test, it will still have most of its propellant on board at the time escape is triggered, and its impact with the desert floor will be most impressive.

&gt;The test should be in the first part of October, and we’ll webcast it live for your viewing pleasure. Details to come.

&gt;If someone forwarded this email to you and you’d like to subscribe to get these updates yourself, you can do so [here](https://www.blueorigin.com/interested). In my next email update, I hope to give you a sneak peek of the orbital vehicle we’ve been working on for the last few years.

BlueOrigin,"&gt;On our most recent flight, we performed a test to prove the Crew Capsule could safely land with only two of its three parachutes open. On a nominal flight with all three parachutes deployed, the capsule descends at about 16 mph before firing a retrorocket just a few feet above the ground.  This retrorocket firing is what creates the large cloud of dust you see just before the capsule lands, and slows the capsule down to 3 mph before it touches the ground. This last bit of speed is absorbed by a ring shaped crushable bumper made of aluminum honeycomb material mounted on the bottom of the capsule. The ring is made of eight segments.

&gt;On this last mission, with one chute intentionally failed, the capsule was descending at 23 mph before firing its retrorocket. The retrorocket took out most of that velocity, and the crushable ring did the rest of the job. Below, you can see a couple of pictures of the crushable after the flight test. The first picture shows it mounted under the vehicle after we lifted it off the ground post-flight. The second picture shows a side view of the eight segments after we removed them from the vehicle. Even with one chute out, the crushable barely crushed. When new, the crushable is about 5.5 inches high and can crush down to less than one inch high, providing a constant deceleration force as it crushes. After the mission, the crushable was still over 5 inches high along nearly the entire circumference of the ring.

&gt;We’ve designed the capsule to ensure astronaut safety not just for a failure of one parachute, but even for a failure of two parachutes. In addition to the retrorocket system and the crushable ring, there is an energy absorbing mechanism mounted underneath each seat.

BlueOrigin,"&gt;We broke ground on our orbital vehicle manufacturing site in Florida.

&gt;The 750,000 square foot rocket factory is custom-built from the ground up to accommodate manufacturing, processing, integration and testing. Among other things, the facility hosts large scale friction stir welding and automated composite processing equipment. All of the vehicle will be manufactured in this facility except for the engines. Initial BE-4 engine production will occur at our Kent facility while we conduct a site selection process later this year for a larger engine production facility to accommodate higher production rates.

&gt;I’ve included some photos that will give you an idea of what the vehicle manufacturing facility will look like in December 2017 when it’s complete.

&gt;It’s exciting to see the bulldozers in action--we’re clearing the way for the production of a reusable fleet of orbital vehicles that we will launch and land, again and again.

BlueOrigin,"I gathered some data based on the speed and time from the live webcast from flight 4 of the New Shepard. Assumed the rocket is going just straight up and down, which is a simplification, but accurate enough for this application.    
[Data vs altitude](http://i.imgur.com/aRFDjsO.jpg)  
[Data vs time](http://i.imgur.com/hJuBeoB.jpg)  
  
Some observations:  
- Initial TWR of about 1,5.     
- Thrust is reduced 15sec before MECO, likely to achieve passing the Karman line with maximum fuel reserves for landing.  
- 'Weightless'/free-falling time of about 200sec, or 3min 20sec.  
- Significant effect of atmosphere on acceleration only occurs well below 40km altitude.  
- The 15sec of 5mph constant landing speed costs somewhat below 150m/s delta-v extra compared to a suicide burn.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/4pwyf1/analysis_of_telemetry_from_webcast_from_launch_4/

Now, it's the NYSE, so im sure most of that will bounce back, but. What effect could that have on blue origin? None? Is Bezos not putting any more of his money into BO, just that initial start?

* Three-Dimensional Critical Wetting Experiment in Microgravity
* Effective Interfacial Tension Induced Convection Experiment
* Microgravity Experiment on Dust Environments in Astrophysics

**Further Info:**

* Although they been improving, Blue Origin are rather sketchy at releasing info, we will do our best to supply legitimate, confirmed information as quickly as possible but we cannot guarantee we will have that information quickly.
* We will be updating this area with relevant information as the launch coverage progresses.
* Feel free to post to your heart's content but be civil, this is not a place for arguments, rude comments or content not related to the launch. We will ban anyone whom we feel are not complying to these simple rules.
* We will be hosting a thread after the launch on what you thought of this thread, and what you think we could change/do better, just to gauge what people want to see next time. Please keep these sort of comments until that thread has opened (unless it's something that needs to be done immediately).

BlueOrigin,"&gt;We’re making multiple copies of the BE-4 to take us through our development campaign, along with a healthy amount of hardware spares to mitigate schedule and technical risks encountered along the way - - a “hardware rich” approach to development. To maintain a fast pace, we’ve elected over the past years to invest heavily in key machines, tooling and people for the production of BE-4 so we can control critical processes in-house.

BlueOrigin,"You might remember the Apollo 15 capsule had one parachute fail during its return to earth prompting the recovery ship USS Okinawa to radio to Worden, Irwin and Scott in the Command Module “You have a streamed chute. Stand by for a hard impact.”

 [Parachute failure on Apollo 15](http://imgur.com/5idkzwC)

A parachute failure is a credible scenario in even the most carefully designed recovery system, so a robust vehicle needs to accommodate that possibility through redundancies and margin designed and built into each subsystem that protects the astronauts during landing. The New Shepard crew capsule is designed to safely land the crew even in the event of a parachute failure.

As I mentioned briefly in the last e-mail, we’re about to do that test. In addition to redundant parachutes, the crew capsule is equipped with a two-stage crushable structure that absorbs landing loads, along with seats that use a passive energy absorbing mechanism to reduce peak loads to the occupant. As an added measure of redundancy, the crew capsule is equipped with a “retro rocket” propulsive system that activates just a few feet above the ground to lower the velocity to approximately 3 ft/sec at touchdown. This final maneuver causes the dust cloud you can see when the crew capsule lands.

We’re planning to demonstrate the redundancies built into the capsule on this re-flight of the vehicle by intentionally failing one drogue and one main parachute during descent. This should occur around 7 ½ minutes into the flight at an altitude of 24,000 feet.

Our other goals for this mission include continuing to learn about our reusable architecture by actually reusing it (this will be the fourth flight of the same hardware), further demonstrating the predictability and repeatability of vehicle performance, and executing pre-planned flight control maneuvers on the booster and crew capsule via fin deflections, TVC deflections and RCS firings to observe system response in order to reduce modeling uncertainties.

We’ll provide a heads up when we know the flight date, but it will likely be before the end of the month.

BlueOrigin,"Back in March, we shared with you our efforts on building two new test cells to further support risk reduction testing on the BE-4.  We began the construction of these additional facilities in October last year and we’ve just commissioned the first of these cells last week.  This test cell is pressure fed and supports the development of the preburner start and ignition sequence timing that will be used on the upcoming full scale powerpack test campaign.  As mentioned in a prior email, one of the many benefits of a privately funded engine development is that we can make and implement decisions quickly. We made the decision to build these two new test cells as a team in a 10 minute discussion.  Less than three weeks later we were pouring concrete and now we have an operating pressure fed test cell 7 months later. Private funding and rapid decision making are two of the reasons why the BE-4 is the fastest path to eliminate U.S. dependence on the Russian-made RD-180.


[Commissioned Preburner Test Facility (thanks /u/old_sellsword)](http://i.imgur.com/hbc8UzT.jpg)

This new pressure fed facility is capable of supporting full scale preburner risk reduction.  If you look closely, you’ll see we already have the 14 inch diameter test article integrated into the facility ready for initial testing.  More on that as we have it.
 
We’re also finishing our mission planning for another flight of New Shepard, which will be our fourth flight with this vehicle.  One of the fundamental tenets of Blue Origin is that the safest vehicle is one that is robust and well understood.  Each successive mission affords us the opportunity to learn and improve our vehicles and their modeling.  We have stepwise expanded our flight envelope on the booster and crew capsule on every mission. On our most recent flight, we performed maneuvers on the crew capsule to help characterize its aerodynamics and reduce our model uncertainties. On this next mission, we’ll execute additional maneuvers on both the crew capsule and the booster to increase our vehicle characterization and modeling accuracy.
 
On this upcoming mission we also plan to stress the crew capsule by landing with an intentionally failed parachute, demonstrating our ability to safely handle that failure scenario.  It promises to be an exciting demonstration.  We’ll be sharing more with you about the upcoming mission as we have it.

BlueOrigin,"Another newsletter update from Blue Origin:

&gt;In the BE-4 preburner, a very small portion of the engine’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel mixes and burns with all of the engine’s liquid oxygen to produce hot gaseous oxygen, which is used to drive the turbine and spin the turbopumps. Oxygen and LNG burn stoichiometrically above 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and temperatures of about 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit or more are needed to reliably ignite and sustain the reaction. No practical turbine materials would survive at that temperature, especially in a reusable application. To resolve this, the BE-4 preburner mixes unburned oxygen into the burned gas stream to dilute the combustion gases and reduce the overall temperature to about 700 degrees Fahrenheit. If this mixing process isn’t meticulously designed, hot spots can persist in the stream and limit turbine life.

&gt;To design the preburner to provide uniform temperature, we use 3-D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to model the LNG and liquid oxygen combustion process. CFD predicts fluid behavior by solving the Navier-Stokes equations to describe how the velocity, pressure, temperature, and density of a moving fluid relate. CFD of reacting flows, especially those that also involve a phase change, is much, much harder because it must also solve chemistry along with state equations. Combusting CFD has only become practical with recent advances in chemical physics models and computing power.

&gt;*[Combusting CFD modeling of the BE-4 preburner shows temperature distribution of hot gaseous oxygen entering the turbine](https://i.imgur.com/ufeI0wv.png)*

&gt;To date, we’ve completed several million core hours of CFD modeling of BE-4 combustion processes. Modeling of the preburner shows good mixing and temperature uniformity upstream of the turbine. The combustion and temperature data we’ve gathered in our subscale testing correlate with our CFD predictions and show that our preburner sizing and injector element design meet design requirements. The ability to do combusting CFD simulations doesn’t eliminate the need for rigorous testing, but it will significantly shorten the test-fail-fix loop on the test stand. We’ll keep you updated.

BlueOrigin,"A while ago I read the book ""The Rocket Company"" by Patrick Stiennon, in which he describes a two-stage reusable rocket. He explains that the first stage of the rocket (DH-1) launched straight up more or less (though there was some adjustments due to the spin of the Earth) and afterwards landed, vertically, at the launch pad.

Having read that and having seen the landings of the New Shepherd launch vehicle, my question is would the straight up vertical launch profile make sense for the Very Big Brother? 

I ask this because it seems like by going with this ""vertical only"" launch for the first stage of the Very Big Brother, Blue Origin could then leverage the technology and experience gained from New Shepherd and achieve the reusability of the first stage more quickly (I'm assuming the first stage of the Very Big Brother will be derived from New Shepherd)? 

On the other hand I guess there is a disadvantage here in that the first stage would not contribute much to the horizontal acceleration needed to get to orbital velocity... I'm wondering what others think about this?

BlueOrigin,"I just got this email from Blue Origin:

&gt;BE-4 testing is well underway at Blue Origin. To date, we’ve completed more than 170 staged-combustion tests – including 51 starts on a single regeneratively cooled chamber and nozzle. The preburner performed flawlessly and the main injector consistently demonstrated performance at the high end of our predictions, giving us confidence that we’ll get good specific impulse when we go to full-scale engine testing later this year.

&gt;We’re building two new test cells. The first is a high-pressure cell that lets us run short-duration, full-scale isolated preburner tests. We’ll use this cell to refine the ignition sequence and understand the start transients. The second is another full engine test cell. Having two full engine test positions will allow us to further increase the testing pace.

&gt;One of the many benefits of a privately funded engine development is that we can make and implement decisions quickly. Building these two new test cells is a $10 million commitment, and we as a team made the decision to move forward in 10 minutes.  Less than three weeks later we were pouring the needed three-foot thick foundations. Private funding and rapid decision making are two of the reasons why the BE-4 is the fastest path to eliminate U.S. dependence on the Russian-made RD-180.

BlueOrigin,"....and that the New Shepard is actually a reusable second stage being developed and tested in plain sight with the space tourism angle just a cover?

The choice of hydrogen screams upper-stage and I think we've all guessed that the engines would see double duty in the future on a second stage but....  what if we're looking at the stage itself?

The bottom of the rocket is round, could they be planning on integrating a heat shield so it could survive re-entry from orbital speeds after delivering a payload?  A bigger methalox first stage is probably in the works based on tumors surrounding the BE-4, if they can R&amp;D landing experience on the smaller second stage first, it will probably help when the bigger rocket's ready to fly.

BlueOrigin,"I'm no expert, just trying to calculate/guess the capability of the potential Blue Origin LVs with some maths.

**The engines.**

BE-4 Engine

 * Mass(guess based on RD-191): 2.7t

 * Thrust SL 2400 kN

 * estimating ISP of 315s sl and 340s vac

BE-3U Engine:

 *  mass guess (from J-2 ) 1.2t

 *  Thrust Vacuum 760 kN

 *  vac isp estimate 450s


Also i'm going to use the gross approximation that if a vehicle has adequate TWR, and 9500 m/s Delta-V, then it can reach LEO.

**BB - Single BE-4 Vehicle:**
__________________
Max vehicle mass: 212t (1.15 liftoff TWR)

The vehicle can't possibly weight more then this including payload knowing the thrust of the BE-4

=calculate starting with initial S2 TWR of ~0.68 (relatively typical for a 2nd stage)=
total S2 mass = 95t + fairings/payload

S2 dry fraction = 0.084, based of S-IVB 

upper dry mass 8.0 t

prop mass 87t


g*450*log((95.0+7)/(8+7)) = 8459m/s

this of course leaves about a mass of 109t for S1, this is pretty ridiculous, but would almost work except the there'd be too much of the early flight with low TWR, we'll come back to this.

**Try something more realistic for a single engine booster. try starting with initial S2 TWR of ~1 (unusually high)**

670/g = 68.3, lets say S2 mass is 60, so with average payload initial TWR should be around 1.

S2 total mass: 60t

upper dry mass fraction  0.0917 (S-IVB)

Dry: 5.5

Prop mass 54.5

figures where arrived at by looking at the dry/wet mass of the Saturn V 3rd stage, so approximate, but probably not too far off.

max TWR = 670/(g*(5.5)) = 12.4, this is pretty high with minimal payload, though the deep throttling of the BE-3 makes this less of a problem.
Delta-V(with 10t payload) = g * 450 * log((60+10)/(5.5+10)) = 6653 m/s

diameter 3.6m - height 24.5m

Stage 1:

Total Mass: 152

Dry mass fraction:0.111 based on on DIV-H

Dry mass: 16.9t 

Delta-V(10t payload ) = 2864 m/s
flight TWR 1.15 - ~2.9


g * 327.5 * log(212/(16.9+60.0+10)) + g * 450 * log((60+10)/(5.5+10)) = 9517 m/s

Result: a more normally proportioned LV, but with a High TWR upper, this actually causes a loss in performance, as the upper stage now has a poorer mass fraction than it could have.
payload: 10t to LEO, expendable




**VBB - 3 engine Launch Vehicle.**
__________________
Ok, the fun one, 2 stages, 3 first stage engines, this makes a much more typical looking LV.
Maximum mass of this vehicle should be about 638t, so this masses a bit more than the Falcon 9.


For this, lets use the spec of the 95t mass 2nd stage i calculated first earlier



**Now the 1st stage.**

max 1st stage mass  = 536t

58.3t dry mass

prop mass 454t

TWR 1.15 - 4.3

g * 327.5 * log(638/(58.3+95.0+27)) + g * 450 * log((95+27)/(8.0+27)) = 9569 m/s

So our 3 engine rocket can send 27t to LEO in expendable mode.

Now i don't know the how much you would have to reduce the payload to to be reusable. you probably want to subtract the extremely rough 15% or 30% (RTLS) figures quoted for SpaceX, maybe a tiny bit more because of the lack of suicide burn.

(If you want to see the imagery of the 'base' you need to tilt the perspective of the google maps image.)

I think it might be a hub between different modules of a Blue Origin moon or marsbase. Why a hub? Because its the most efficient way of getting around between modules. Also, it has stairs that go all around.
If you extend the circles to the right via an imaginary line further out (I know all of this sounds like a conspiracy theory) you can see a small circle on about the height of New Shepard or a large one below the hub.
Its easy to imagine other modules and a New Shepard functioning as a module itself (modules could be landed as cargo).

I got the idea because the lines and circles look like the connecting rod of a car: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecting_rod#/media/File:Haupt_und_Nebenpleuel_BMW_132.jpg

finally, why would they build a mockup so far at the side of their property that they're gonna run out of space? Probably because they dont want anyone to know that they're building one, yet.

BlueOrigin,"So by now we've all heard about the successful re-use of the New Shephard booster (if any Blue Origin engineers are here, well done, you guys did great!)

My question is, what now? What're Blue Origins plans for 2016?
Specifically:

Now that re-usability of the New Shephard booster is confirmed, what needs to be done for the system to be man-rated and put on the market for suborbital toruism? And is that likely to happen this year, or is that wildly optimistic? As far as I know, there's been no manned test-flights of the system, although unlike Virgin Galactic New Shephards tests have actually done the flight profile it's supposed to do. 

Do we have any idea about the size of Blue Origins orbital rocket design? Are we likely to get more information about it this year?

BlueOrigin,"I was trying to get an idea of how well the BE-3 compares to the RL-10, in particular any authoritative info about its Isp.  I figured hey, why not just ask?  So I submitted a note via their Contact Us form asking for details on the BE-3, specifically about its Isp.  I also took a shot and asked if they have a public date for the next New Shepard launch.

They sent me a nice note the next day and told me what a great, modern, low-cost engine it was.  They also pointed me to the Technology section of their website for info on BE-3 (which I, of course, had already looked at), and said they wouldn't release any information outside of what was posted there.  They also said they couldn't tell me anything about the next launch.

I sort of figured that's what would happen, but didn't hurt to try.  Even though I don't have new info to share, I figured I'd post about it, in case it had occurred to anyone else to try. They've opened up a lot as a company, but they still keep much close to the vest...

Hoping for another NS launch soon.  While they wait for the RTF it would be a small comfort to the SpaceX crowd to see *some* rocket RTLS, even if it wasn't Falcon.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/3mflpl/no_luck_getting_details_about_the_be3/

Since he hasn't declared any Mars or Planetary ambitions (and he kinda lost the development race to Spacex so far, even though BO has had a head start of two years). Bezos is not the guy to think small and might even consider stepping down as CEO of Amazon when BO takes off.
Just as Elon indicated that he might not always be CEO of Tesla.

What could Blue Origin possibly do of substance in space?

Also how would they interact with a probably dominant Spacex? (Are they gonna sue everytime Elon does something first?)

BlueOrigin,"I think it is very telling that Blue Origin currently has deals to sell the BE-4 engine to both ULA for the Vulcan, and to Boeing for the XS-1 reusable booster.

Since the Shuttle was designed, hardly any rocket engines have been designed in the US, and those that have (RS-68 for example) were evolutions of previous engines. It is as if the USA decided that after the SSME engine, there was no more point in developing chemical rocket engines.

And here we have this company who has never flown any payload even into a suborbital mission, but has decided to invest in modern rocket engine technology. Even with the engine years into the future, some very respectable companies seem to be jumping on it for their new products. That's just because there is no alternative! 

Aerojet Rocketdyne is planning the AR-1 engine, but they are years behind Blue Origin. And AR-1 would probably not be usable for XS-1 since it needs to be reusable.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/3g3w33/blue_origins_success_shows_the_demise_of_rocket/

While I am not one to read to much into these types of things, I cannot help but wonder if lunar development is BO's long term ambition, similar to the way that Space X had their sight set on Mars at some point in the long term future. Of course I could see the prominent placement of the moon in this video as simply a choice to show something familiar and inspiring, more of a marketing tactic than anything else. It does make you wonder, however, what they plan to do beyond develop this suborbital vehicle and eventually their own orbital rocket. Space X is at the stage where they have orbital flight capability and thus is in a position to make it clear when they intend to achieve without being laughed at, do you think that some type of formal lunar proposals might come from them once they are doing the same?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/34gxxd/noticed_that_in_the_animation_video_it_starts_and/

I have seen some advice to just be yourself; dont be afraid to say 'I don't know' to the question; and brush up on engineering fundamentals. I am a recent grad EE major and to be honest I have anxiety when it comes to answering technical questions. I just want to know when the recruiter says to brush up on engineering fundamentals, do they mean like op amps, KVL, KCL, ohms law, etc? Sorry for asking this but I am the type of person that learns the subject but tends to forget it along the way.

I do have a passion in space exploration and a little about myself I have been doing astrophotography for about 10 years and have taken pictures of planets, galaxy,nebula,etc of our universe.

Unfortunately I can't get a really good baseline number to scale everything too.

There is a little astronaut shown in some of these slide decks but it turns out that the astronaut height isn't a consistent item from slide to slide, resulting in really massive variations that don't make sense to the rest of the components and the integrated stack renderings.

There was an earlier picture from Blue Origin listing the lander as capable as 14 tonnes to the lunar surface (I can dig it up and post it if requested). This corresponds VERY well to a 14 tonne wet mass of the ascent element given the ISP, deltaV requirements, and a couple basic assumptions on crew cabin mass etc. One can pretty well work backwards on all the other elements to determine their mass. I estimate the lunar lander has to mass 15 tonnes through TLI. Either New Glenn has to be capable of that or the lander is larger and takes itself through TLI from a GTO-like orbit (which I doubt is the case but one could estimate propellant mass from these renderings and tank volumes).",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/hfr0sp/eric_berger_with_blue_moon_details_from_a/

BlueOrigin,"New Glenn has 9+ launches on their manifest. Satellites are generally ordered 2-4 years in advance of the expected launch, and launches are generally ordered 2+ years before the expected launch. This information is usually public: either the satellite buyer or the satellite builder is often a public company, and this is material information. Arianespace (which provides Ariane launches) is also a public company.

Now that New Glenn's initial launch is expected around the end of 2021, a brief 18 months from now, we ought to be able to see a lot of public information about the satellites that are on New Glenn's manifest. So I attempted to look it all up, and here's what I found:

3 GEO satellite launch orders

* 1 for Eutelsat
* Launch order announced March 7, 2017 -- one satellite for launch in 2021/2022, to be selected 12 months prior
* Eutelsat HOTBIRD 13F launch 2021 -- Ariane NET September 2021
* Eutelsat HOTBIRD 16G launch 2021 -- Ariane NET September 2021
* Eutelsat KONNECT VHTS launch 2022 -- Ariane64
* Eutelsat 10B ordered Oct 29, 2019 -- launch 2022 -- no known launch provider -- could be the New Glenn payload
* [No other public satellite orders](https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/sat-contracts.htm)


* 1 for mu Space Corp
* Launch order announced March 12, 2018 for launch in 2020
* Had yet to select a manufacturer at announcement
* [Article from June 16, 2019 says ""as soon as 2021""](https://www.thephuketnews.com/rising-stars-thai-start-up-mu-space-corp-to-launch-space-tourism-in-asian-first-71765.php)
* No known satellite order


* 1 for SKY Perfect JSAT
* Launch order announced March 12, 2018
* Contract does not specify what satellite will be launched
* [July 1, 2018 article says the satellite is yet to be procured](https://spacenews.com/sky-perfect-jsat-mulls-future-technology-investments/)
* [All known previously ordered satellites have launched](https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sat/sat-contracts.htm)

6+ LEO Constellation launch orders

* 1+ Launch for Telesat
* Launch contract signed January, 2019 for LEO satellites
* [Contract to build LEO constellation has not been awarded to date](https://spacenews.com/telesat-preparing-for-mid-2020-constellation-manufacturer-selection/)
* Telesat has no known GEO satellites on order
* LEO constellation has a deadline to have 30 satellites up by Jan 1, 2023


* 5 launches for OneWeb
* OneWeb is in bankruptcy and may or may not continue deploying their constellation
* The bankruptcy filing lists Arianespace as an unsecured creditor, and not Blue Origin

BlueOrigin,"Long story short, Boeing moved me across the country a little less than a year ago into a job that has not at all turned out to be what I thought it was and I'd really like to get out. Every single day I find myself wading through a tangled, bureaucratic cesspool of archaic processes, procedures, and specifications and its driving me insane. Somehow there are a million procedures for everything and yet no one actually knows how to do anything. Its quite mind-boggling, honestly. 

I desperately need a more modern, faster-paced, and technically-challenging work environment/job. I love aerospace but I'm beginning to realize I simply cannot handle shit loads of paper pushing and bureaucracy. I cannot handle how unbelievably niche and narrow-scoped everyone's job here seems to be. I want to stay in aerospace but I'm wondering if its possible to cut down on the red tape even a little bit in this industry.

BlueOrigin,"Hi, thanks for reading my thread.

I just watched the going to space to save Earth vid (a little late to the party) and thought it was curious that Bezos didn't delve more into how he envisions the extraction of the “limitless resources of space” will actually work. There is a moment where the screen shows a picture of the Moon and it reads “everything we need” or something to that effect however clearly we can't just keep mining the Moon indefinitely for the raw materials needed to build O'Neill Cylinders or it will become hollowed out, there's only so much Moon to mine, and the whole idea is to *not* mine the Earth in the future so I guess that leaves asteroid mining, which would truly provide near infinite quantities of raw materials, precious metals, water, etc. 

For the record as far as I know the economics of asteroid mining are still a bit hand wavey at best and would consider myself “neutral” on the concept, it seems like rather than a source of economic profit for Earth based communities likes those dumb pop-sci articles imply (“The First Trillionaires in Space!”) it would actually work more in a kind of “post scarcity” scenario for humanity like Bezos envisions, perhaps swarms of BO manufactured cheap, expendable AI powered drones mine the asteroids and the raw materials in question aren't a source of significant economic value by themselves due to the inherent near infinite supply, they are just the building blocks of things like O'Neill Cylinders. 

I dunno just kind of puzzled that he didn't go into more detail of “Gate #2” i.e. in-space manufacturing, I mean he did concede no one has any idea how it will work yet but I'm sure he has at least some theories considering the investment he is making in the concept.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/ge3dq4/blue_origin_oneill_cylinders_and_asteroid_mining/

SLS is used to send crew to high lunar orbit using Orion.       
A transfer stage, ascent stage and descent stage are sent to high lunar orbit using 3 commercial rockets or 1 SLS. Then they rendezvous together. Crew moves to this from Orion. 

Transfer stage takes ascent and descent to low lunar. Transfer stage goes back to high lunar. Can be reused next time if fuel supplies arrive.     

Descent and ascent stage lands on moon. Astronauts do blah blah blah.

Ascent stage takes crew back to high lunar. Ascent stage can be reused for next mission if fuel supplies arrive.   

Crew transfers to orion, go back to blue origin (earth).    
For next trip to moon:
Crew goes from earth to high lunar in using SLS/Orion.

New descent stage + fuel supplies (for ascent and transfer) sent to high lunar.

I understand that SpaceX designed their methalox Raptors due to the specifics of ISRU propellant production on Mars.

BlueOrigin,"Given Bezos vision of millions working in cislunar space. Here is how I see it:

1. In near term they should push on making NS and NG commercially successful.

2. Crewed NG.

3. Upper stage outfitting and powerful rockets with big payload fairings to allow launching of space station modules (utilizing the space available in the payload bay + the upper stage is more effective than launching just station modules). Eventually, after ISS is retired, they could build orbital station and lease it to governments and private entities, and use it for their own research.

3. They have to be heavily invested in the lunar program. The moon is the springboard for Bezos' vision. Metals and fuels to mine, low g and no atm to allow for easy and cheap launches - mass drivers and space elevators will also work. It is perfect if you want orbital mega structures. I hope that the Chinese will push forward with the moon too, just to be sure that the space race won't be cancelled again. Bezos can't do this alone without the government, because it is a capital intensive effort with very vague prospects of monetary return. Bezos won't just throw his money down the drain.

A little bit about me: currently a first-year PhD student in materials science and engineering with a focus in metallurgy of additively manufactured (AM) high-temperature shape memory alloys in a top 15 engineering school. Prior to my PhD, I did two materials processes and characterization internships at NASA Langley Research Center (total of 1 year), initially working with carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs), and then AM Titanium alloy. I have BS and MS degrees in mechanical engineering, and have graduate research assistant (GRA) and graduate teaching assistant (GTA) experiences as well. Lastly, I have been involved with a few journal and conference publications (2nd author).

I am passionate in the aerospace materials (metallurgy) field, and space exploration in general. It's impossible for me to count the number of times I've contacted Blue's recruiters on LinkedIn.

The passion, persistence, and experience (and passion for learning) are all there...So, what's really missing?!

BlueOrigin,"Hi Everyone!

I hope it's ok to post more questions here unless there is another thread.

As my title summarizes, a recruiter reached out to me for some positions at BO that are not exactly in my area, however he likes my skill set and we will be working accordingly. He wants to aim at a more general resume for now as we narrow down openings. I have about 4 years of industry experience at some major aerospace companies, and as my ID implies, I did my master's degree in hybrid rocket performance. Just getting a shot at applying is a dream come true! After reading some posts here, I just had a few questions:

1) For my experience level (\~4 years) would 3 pages be too much? My resume is a 2 pager but I was told to expand details, especially on a recent aircraft program that went public that I was on a flight sciences team for. 

2)  Any particular software packages and languages to focus on?  Is Matlab well accepted at BO or shunned due to being tied off a lot by Mathworks? (Seems to always have a camp of dedicated and hater engineers in every R&amp;D group I've been in). 

3) Would stressing NPSS be worth it? This is used for aircraft engines but it was originally aimed at rocketry I believe. 

4) Anything in particular to avoid? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much, especially to the other Q/A threads here, they've been very helpful for getting to grips with company culture!",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/exvd7x/recruiter_reached_out_to_me_resume_tips/

BlueOrigin,"For Blue Origin's ""National Team"" for Artemis and the Human Landing System consists of 3 parts: the Lander, Ascent vehicle, and then the Transfer Stage. The latter at first looks to be pretty boring - it's just a tug that takes the two parts from Gateway to Low Lunar Orbit where it is unceremoniously discarded.

What we know of it so far is quite sparse. It will be built by Northrop Grumman, be a derivative of Cygnus (likely the same sattelite bus they use), and be [powered by Blue Origin's BE-7.](https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/10/22/bezos-says-space-industry-stalwarts-will-help-blue-origin-build-moon-lander/)

But thinking on it more I am actually pretty excited about this lil transfer stage. Because it should be a very capable and versatile space tug that can open up a lot of possibilities.

First in order to meet the requirements of the lander it must be capable of holding its hydrolox propellant for over a long duration (at least compared to traditional upper stages). Second it must be capable of autonomous docking.  Finally it is quite likely that this transfer stage would provide all in orbit maneuvering from departing Gateway to orienting the stack in LLO before separation. 

We can take some pretty educated guesses on the total mass of his lander from [NASA's conceptual outline of the 3 stage HLS and the deltaV each stage would provide.](https://planetary.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/images/charts-diagrams/2019/20190404_3-stage-lander-concept.png)  So we see a 12 to 15 tonne stage performing 850 m/s dV* on a total payload of 24-28 tonnes. 

In terms of engines the [BE-7 at 40kN of thrust](https://www.blueorigin.com/engines/be-7) is about 1/3 the size of the RL-10s 110kN, and about double the Orion service module's 26.6kN AJ10. Something to keep in mind.

Knowing that the transfer stage is hydrolox and should have high ISP with BE-7 (guesstimated at 450s), a 4 tonne dry mass stage could take a 28 tonne payload from gateway to LLO using only 7 tonnes of propellant (0.85 km/s dV).  At a glance that looks like quite a bit of extra margin, but around 1.5 tonnes of extra propellant would be needed up front for the transfer stage to get from TLI to Gateway*.

**So what else could this transfer stage do?**

The first thing that comes to mind is that half serious proposal last year to use two commercial launchers to perform EM-1 with Orion instead of SLS. One of the missing pieces was the ability to dock ICPS to Orion. A stretched version of this transfer stage should have no problems there and be able to take Orion from an earth orbit out to TLI. Alternatively the long duration elements of this transfer stage could replace the Orion's primary propulsion and might just be light enough to launch to LEO on New Glenn (I think its close as a quick check). 

Second would be general tug duties. In the near term it could take larger payloads to Gateway or Low Lunar Orbit. While overkill, it could be used to deliver habitation modules that lack their own propulsion system that would otherwise need to be co manifested with Orion on SLS. By staging somewhere before TLI the tug should be able to deliver even larger modules than would be possible with a 2 stage New Glenn.

Long term with refueling it could be used to shuttle all sorts of things around cis-lunar space.

Then there are duties as integrated deep space probe propulsion buses, sort of like what Rocketlab proposes with Photon.   

TLDR I think that transfer stage could evolve to serve a lot of different tasks and it deserves a little more attention regarding its role as a piece of infrastructure in cis-lunar space.


*There is a good breakdown of high thrust deltaV requirements around [Gateway on Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v_budget)",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/eukh8g/thoughts_on_the_blue_originnorthrop_grumman/
BlueOrigin,"Hi everyone,

I'm making a Reddit account solely to ask this questions, I have not found any helpful tips elsewhere. I'm very excited to have gotten a call back form Blue Origin two days ago in response to the Program Planning and Control Specialist position I applied to. The recruiter explained I will first have a technical phone screen and then move on to an in-person presentation/panel interview if the phone screen goes well.  
I'm seeking any advice anyone has for this role in particular, there seem to be plenty of posts for engineering positions. I'm not sure what types of questions to anticipate for the technical screening or what type of personality Blue is looking for. The only thing I know is that this would be a dream role and I want to prepare as best as possible for the interview/s. Thank you!

Nearly 20 months ago the Go4Liftoff website was first launched. Four months later the Go4Liftoff Android App was also launched. Between now and then both have undergone a huge rework of both platforms. Both have grown to include a huge amount of data whilst keeping the platforms fast, easy to use and intuitive. Both designs have been improved too as the old designs were outdated and in some cases a little ugly.

Features include :

\- Upcoming and past launches with powerful filtering tools

\- Reusable first stages

\- Agencies

\- Astronauts

\- Space Stations

\- Events

\- Space News

Our Website - [https://go4liftoff.com](https://go4liftoff.com/)

Our Android App - [http://bit.ly/go4liftoff](http://bit.ly/go4liftoff)

I would like to give a special mention to [u/Nosudrum](https://www.reddit.com/u/Nosudrum/) who supported the project and provided input throughout.

So please take a look around and let me know what you think of our platforms! If you have any issues or recommendations for either of the platforms please do let us know and we'll strive to fix any issues and implement any ideas!

BO says the extended version of the lunar lander (which will also be used for crewed landings) can transport 20 tons to the lunar surface.

BO lists the payload to GEO (less energy then TLI) as 13 tons.

So there are three possibilities.

* They will use expendable launches which have no listed payload capacity
* They will use orbital refueling

Let's see what Blue Origin has been cooking up the past few years.

* Have built and launched a sub-orbital rocket. Becoming the first people to successfully  land a rocket from space, using rocket engines. Have launched 100 science payloads to space aiding in scientific research.

* They built and are currently developing the BE-4 engine. A very important rocket engine as it will power two future rockets to space.

* They are refurbishing LC36 and upgrading it to launch New Glenn.

* They have built a rocket factory near LC36 which will manufacture and refurbish New Glenn.

* They are currently constructing their rocket engine factory in Alabama. Which will make BE4's.

* They are currently building the New Glenn rocket. Set to launch in 2021.

* They are three years into development of Blue Moon lander, with over seventeen minutes of firing time for the new BE-7 engines.

BlueOrigin,"I have been applying to Blue Origin nonstop for about the last 6 months since I will be graduating soon. I have had interviews with other space industry companies, but Blue has been my white whale. Of all of the space companies out there Blue has the road map I believe in the most, so I know that it is my goal because I will be best able to give back. At this point, I just want to know if I should be doing something different, so I can keep grinding to do what I can to land an interview.

Info about myself:

I am a current PhD student who will be graduating in May whose dissertation work is next generation structural composite materials development under NASA funding. I have a pretty heavy R&amp;D background and have been specializing in polymer matrix composites for about 8.5 years now. Below are my old resume and my newer stream lined version to give anyone interested more of an idea of what I do:

BlueOrigin," I am curious about the general salary range and other benefits. I was afraid of asking these to the recruiter before getting into onsite interview.

For Engineers level 3 what is the salary band? I’ve looked at the Glassdoor and it seems around 110K\~130k? Can it be more? Generally, what is the raise % after 1 year?

Another question is, what is the 401k match %? I also saw in Glassdoor that it is 3%, which seems very low compared to other companies. I also heard that some stocks are given (although BO is not public so can’t liquidate these stocks.) It seems like general opinion is that these stocks are worthless until maybe after 10\~20 years from now that BO maybe do IPO and listed on the stock market.

What other general perks does it provide? I heard that pets are allowed in the office. What about free coffee, free food? What about PTOs? Can I wear t-shirts and jeans to office? Any free EV car charging? Commuter benfits like subsidizing vanpool, shower facility for bicycle riders, etc?

Any info will be greatly appreciated. 

Plus, if you rather share via PM, I can also share via PM about compensation info for Boeing.

By the way, Boeing does not provide free food at all. No free coffee either. The cafeteria is served by Eurest and its food cost is around 8bucks minimum and the quality is subpar.

Boeing has good commuter benfits, pays out vanpool or bus card upto 60bucks. Most building has very good shower/locker for bike commuters.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/dpft1j/what_are_blue_origin_salary_and_other_perks/

BlueOrigin,"I posted this on the Spacexlounge subreddit, but I would like to know Blue Origin's fan perspective on this issue.

As many space fans know, SpaceX is hard at work on their new revolutionary Starship. A fully reusable spaceship that will take humans to the moon and back. The first prototypes are already being built at a breakneck speed using their revolutionary construction method that has cut down on cost and complexity.

Starship will launch to orbit by the end of next year and shortly thereafter carry crew, according to SpaceX. Elon Musk has said the cost will be less than a Falcon 9 rocket, perhaps ten million per launch. It can land, get refueled and launch again, with out refurbishment, just like an aircraft. This means that spaceX will offer cheap, safe access to space.

Now the problem for Blue Origin is that their rocket is only partially reusable. Even if it's cheaper than a Falcon 9 (though it will be more expensive because it will have to recoup development costs), they won't be able to offer competitive prices, compared to what Starship will offer. This is problem for long term growth of the company. How will they get payloads when Starship undercuts them on price?

The question then is, how will blue origin compete with Starship? Perhaps the upper stage of the New Glenn could be converted into a reusable ship, but at this stage they don't have much experience even flying to orbit let alone designing and building such a complex spacecraft. They need an answer, but I'm not sure what it will be.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/djy32v/can_blue_origin_compete_with_starship/

BlueOrigin,"Link to the official NASA report here:  https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/luvoir/resources/docs/LUVOIR_FinalReport_2019-08-26.pdf

Credit to NASASpaceFlight Forums's member Su27k for finding the link.

Summary of relevant section:  After consultation with Blue Origin, NASA says the smaller LUVOIR-B version can be launched on New Glenn.

The report also states that New Glenn will be undergoing a Critical Design Review around this time of 2019, and the factory in Cape Canaveral is being completed and will be populated with tooling late this year.

Sounds like Blue Origin will start to bend metal on its first New Glenn flight article once 1) the design passes the CDR, 2) the BE-4 completes flight qualification testing, and 3) the factory construction is complete and the tooling installed.  So figure beginning of 2020 for construction of the first finalized-design New Glenn to start in earnest.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/cyszqr/nasas_luvoir_final_report_released_82619_mentions/
BlueOrigin,"Hey everyone, 

Blue just posted their internship application for next summer and I have a (stupid) question. There is a section that simply states ""Write a 250-word (or less) statement on your passion:""

For those who have had success applying in the past, is this section where I should explain my passion for the space industry? Or is it more of a writing sample and I can explain any passion (space related or not)? Just curious, because I'm sure nearly every response is related to a passion for space and they probably end up being pretty boring/repetitive for the reviewer. So, I'm wondering if it is appropriate to branch out.

So I've steadily watched Blue Origin's Glassdoor rating *plummet* (see the graph) over the past couple years. This is an especially good forum for you current and former employees, contractors, etc. to chime in. 

*Is it worth wanting to or going to work for this company in a couple years if this is the current employment outlook?*

I've heard, read, and seen several things on Glassdoor and in other places...

* Meaningless stock options
* ""Yes men"" culture
* Bad technical management
* Aggressive middle managers
* ""Back-stabby coworkers""
* Low pay
   * Seattle is becoming more expensive to live in
* Bad working environment: (Shrinking desk sizes, gimmicky open office floor plan)
* Kent isn't a nice place to live

BlueOrigin,"The 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing has caused me to ask a question: what testing will Blue Origin do of the Blue Moon hardware?

Back in the 1960s, NASA created the [Lunar Landing Research Vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Landing_Research_Vehicle) to study how they were going to land a vehicle on the Moon. The vehicle consisted of a jet engine pointed downwards, generating enough thrust to simulate the Moon's one-sixth gravity, and other rockets to provide fine control. (This is a similar concept to the earlier Rolls Royce's [Flying Bedstead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Thrust_Measuring_Rig), which led to the Short SC1 and the Harrier Jump Jet).

More recently, NASA have invested in  [Project Morpheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Morpheus), a methalox VTL lunar lander test rig. Masten Aerospace are developing testbeds such as the [XL-1T](https://www.masten.aero/xl1t) to test lunar landing technologies.

So, what are the odds that Blue Origin produce some form of crewed or uncrewed lander, perhaps using a BE-8 as well as a jet engine, to test their systems here on Earth?  They have a certain track record with vertical jets, with their initial Charon VTL system.

Whilst modern computer systems allow simulations that reduce the need for as much hardware testing, it seems likely to me that we'll see some sort of system being tested within the next year. It's costly, but it should reduce mission risk.

Or will they just manage without such a system?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/ch44mw/blue_moon_hardware_testing/

BlueOrigin,"So Bezos talks a big game about building space infrastructure for future generations but it seems that there is no real clarity on what he actually intends to do. Right now, the talk is only about rockets. But that's the easy (relatively) part. What's the plan after that? Will BO only be a very affordable launch provider? Will they fund a moon/mars base etc? 

SpaceX and Musk are very clear in that they want to go to Mars and build a base there. Its a specific actionable plan. Bezos' idea is to move industries to space while we turn earth into giant nature park / residential zone. Its too vague. I imagine that a lot of research and re-work would need to be done for industrial processes that work on earth to work in space. That's stuff that the industry leaders and experts would need to do themselves. Bezos can't do it for them. Maybe he sets up a r&amp;d office to work on tech to build o'neil cylinders?

BlueOrigin,"I have no doubt that we can build viable O'Neill Cylinders - at some point.  It is ""just"" an engineering problem and we are very clever when it comes to technological solutions.  So far in our discussions, this subreddit seems entirely focused on the construction/technology of Cylinders.  That seems like the easy part.

My concerns are more about what life in such a environment would be like.

In particular, the Cylinder appears very fragile to hull damage.  A relatively small breech (compared to the entire hull area) leads to significant loss of atmosphere unless repaired quickly.  The centrifugal force will actively and rapidly vent the air.

Consider a resident hostile force intentionally set on destroying life in the Cylinder.  Perhaps they threaten destruction unless paid a ransom, perhaps they are politically motivated.  Using today's words we would term it a ""terrorist"" organization.  It seems that their mission would easily succeed with little effort.  It wouldn't take much tech to catastrophically damage the hull.  They would probably strike in multiple, far separated locations.  Certainly they would die as well, as self-proclaimed ""martyrs"", undoubtedly.

How could we guard against this occurrence?

Of necessity, I think the government would likely engage in extensive surveillance of the populace.  It seems likely they would take a heavy authoritarian, militaristic approach.  I'm postulating a paranoid streak in the government due to the perceived danger.  The government would be constantly suspicious of their citizens.  I think there would not be much personal freedom, consequently.  (Hello, big brother.)

But a hostile force wouldn't even need access to the interior.  They could stand off at a distance with a mass driver and take out the Cylinder.

That factor leads to the necessity of an external mobile security force for the Cylinder, quite robust.  I'm not sure how even that force would protect against incoming masses at high velocities.  As usual, government support of such a defense team drains more productive activity.

Given these dangers, I'm not sure putting millions of people at risk is a such a good idea.  While I really like the *idea* of O'Neill space colonies, I think they have serious problems due to human behavior issues.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/c8x2g5/the_future_in_oneil_cylinders/

BlueOrigin,"I've been thinking about how Blue Origin will test the New Glenn to qualify it as Operational.

While it could be deployed like the Saturn V, I think this unlikely.  As a quick review, the Saturn V program used an ""all up"" scenario.  Each of the parts, including the complete stages, were ground tested completely.  Finally, the whole rocket was integrated and flown.  The point being that the first time any parts of the rocket flew, it was as a whole Saturn V.

In my opinion, it seems implausible that BO will use this technique for the NG.  The primary motivation for ""all up"" testing of the Saturn V was expediency.  (After all, it was a real space race.)  BO seems to believe in intentional slow development.  ""All up"" testing seems counter to the ""step by step"" and ""slow and steady wins the game"" Blue Origin philosophy.

Thus, I have a hard time imagining that Blue Origin would build a complete New Glenn and launch it for recovery on their ship as the first flight in ""all up"" fashion.  

I think it much more likely that we would see ""hopper"" tests with a reduced first stage, followed by hopper tests with gradually more elaborate first stages, leading to a test of a ""production"" first stage.  Likewise, landing on the actual recovery vessel will occur only in the latter first stage tests.  Why risk an expensive vessel until you have  greater confidence in the test article?  Instead, we will see land-based recovery early in the testing.


Since the second/third stages use vacuum-optimized engines, I don't see a good method of testing them except in flight atop a first stage.  Perhaps some aerospace engineer can elucidate?

In any event, we should have significant, unambiguous, public notice when Blue Origin commences testing.  You can't launch without FAA clearance, after all.  There aren't any secrets, there.

I also speculate (without any real data) that Blue Origin is looking at a year or more of testing prior to a complete flight profile (recovery included).  This is Blue Origin, after all.

So in order to hit a ""2021 New Glenn is operational"" milestone, we should see testing start by the beginning of 2020.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/bt8ins/speculation_on_new_glenn_testing_program_aka_how/

My only guess is that they didn't feel confident with manned propulsive landings when they first designed the rocket. Whatever the case, it doesn't seem like there would be a huge amount of modification needed to keep the capsule attached right (unless the rocket is too top heavy for a safe landing)?

I am generally impressed with Blue Origin, but in one respect I am deeply concerned. In all the press releases, I have not seen any pictures of space tourists wearing space suits, or supplemental oxygen to protect them of the capsule should depressurise...

This is a very real scenario as this community would know that the Soyuz 11 crew died when their cabin depressurised in 1971...

BlueOrigin,"   Let's face it, Old Space concepts/ mission architectures are (within the next few decades at least) going to become very outdated at the rate that SpaceX is progressing with Starship/Superheavy. With that being said Blue Origins mission design for sending humans to the moon should not resemble Apollo but rather should resemble starship instead. Even if some performance is lost with having to carry a side mounted heatsheild around the sheer quantity of performance you get from a Starship style upper stage with orbital refueling is enough to justify the incured performance loss, 

   Overall the Space industry needs to transition from designing missions to land a few astronauts on the moon- mars to launching dozens of people at a time. This is why I think BO should design a integrated upper stage vehicle for New Glenn. For tourist flights the cost incurred by throwing away the upper stage after every flight is too much to be competitive. This is why I think New Glenn should have a Starship style upper stage rather than a traditional upper stage.

p.s - having what is essentially a hydro lox version of Starship would give BO a tremendous advantage over SpaceX in Lunar Operations because BO could take advantage of Lunar ISRU while SpaceX couldn't since there is little to no carbon on the moon.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/biv32n/unpopular_opinion_bo_should_build_an_integrated/

BlueOrigin,"   Earlier today I was thinking about something relating to New Glenn. We know for a fact that After Blue is satisfied with their tourists flights on New Shepherd they are planning on starting manned orbital flights on a New Glenn capsule. While the margin exists for New Glenn to send such a capsule into LEO with just 45 tonnes to LEO it wouldn't have the power to send the Capsule on Trans Lunar Injection. With that being said is there any way that New Glenn could be uprated in terms of thrust and payload capacity to launch manned lunar missions or will we have to wait for New Armstrong? (mid-2030's)

BlueOrigin,"Blue Origin produced the New Shepard rocket with minimal mishaps. The second iteration of New Shepard, NS2, became the first booster rocket to perform a vertical landing after returning to space. The rocket flew to space a total of *five times*. NS2 was not expected to survive its fifth and final flight, as the mission included a high velocity separation of the passenger capsule which was outside of its design parameters. The rocket, however, was never made aware of this fact and landed itself perfectly anyway. 

NS2 now decorates the lobby of the Blue Origin factory in Cape Canaveral as a testament to the tenacity of a booster that was developed with reuse in mind from the start, and for which every precaution was taken to make it reliable for multiple reuses. New Shepard is poised to become the first private rocket to take humans into space. 

This same approach is being used in the design and production of the next Blue Origin rocket, the much larger New Glenn. Having demonstrated reusability with NS and learned many lessons in doing so, the New Glenn will likewise be designed for reuse from its very first flight. The rocket's design is deliberate, as is its mission, and reuse will not be added as an afterthought. 

The main engine of the New Glenn, the BE-4, has already impressed the industry, and inspired so much confidence that it will also be used as the main engine of the ULA Atlas V rocket. BE-4 is also looking to become one of the first, if not the first, ever LOX/methane-fueled engine to bring a rocket into space.

Blue Origin has also made huge strides towards the production and facilitation of the New Glenn rocket, as is made evident by the enormous Blue Origin factory constructed at Cape Canaveral, and to which another huge expansion is already being made. Blue Origin has leased Launch Complex 36 to facilitate launches of New Glenn, and construction around the site is literally transforming the landscape. And as if that weren't enough, Blue Origin is also in the process of refitting a massive freighter ship into an even more massive landing pad for New Glenn - because, again, New Glenn has been designed with reuse in mind from the very start.

When New Glenn launches, it will be faraway the largest, most ambitious rocket in the world, and it has already secured contracts for launches with both private companies as well as government. So while some may tell you that Blue Origin is getting 
nowhere simply due to a persistent social media presence, I would like this thread to remind people that Blue Origin has done great work and will likely keep doing great work - because we have been given no reason to doubt them yet.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/bbabzi/the_really_unpopular_opinion_gradatium_ferociter/

BlueOrigin,"   Let's face it, with all the innovations they have been able to make in such a relatively short period of time. SpaceX is quickly becoming what most people talk about when they refer to the apex of the aerospace/launch industry. The main thing that has driven SpaceX's innovation is the sense of urgency and the aggressive timelines that are placed on the employees while stressful yields some impressive results that are not only amazing in technical terms but also fairly cost effective. Robert Zubrin always says that SpaceX was able to do what NASA is doing with SLS for ""1/3 the time at 1/10th the cost.""

While there are definitely clear benefits to not rushing and rapidly iterating to the point where no two vehicles are the same. The amount of dilly-dallying that Blue Origin is doing given the resources that they have is at this point (IMO) unsustainable and just not going to work. For innovation to occur teams working for any company need to have a sense of urgency to fulfill their timelines, and with BO I am afraid that the lack of that is putting strain on the companies ability to deliver, I mean look at it like this.

SpaceX was founded a whole two years after Blue Origin and within 6 years they had their first orbital vehicle flying (Falcon 1).
It took Blue Origin a full 15 years to just fly a suborbital vehicle. And four years later they are still stuck in test-flight limbo despite not having a single RUD after 10 test flights. While I was hoping the incrementalism would pay off for New Glenn I sadly don't think this is going to be the case. BO is already begging the Airforce to postpone their second round EELV contracts because they don't think New Glenn will be ready by then (2024). IMO their sluggish pace is starting to catch up with them and not in a good sense. Bezos likes to talk about how results are more important than timelines or petty ""races"" which I somewhat agree with, but what I think he fails to realize as that those kinds of results don't happen without a sense of urgency. At this point at their current pace It pains me to say this but I can't see New Glenn flying until 2024, I can't see them flying humans into LEO until 2030 (which by that time SpaceX probably will have landed humans on mars) And we might have to wait until 2040 for New Armstrong which would be embarrassing considering SpaceX probably will have been flying Starship for upwards of 18 year by then, birth to legal adulthood. 

While I am a SpaceX fan (you can probably tell by my username) I really love Blue Origin as well and I want them to succeed almost as badly as I want SpaceX to be successful. If Musk is inspired by ""The Case for Mars"" then Bezos and BO are inspired by ""The High Frontier"" I see both martian colonization as well as a robust cis-lunar infrastructure and economy as complementary as well as mutually beneficial to one another which is why I want both to succeed. However I just don't see that happening with their current business philosophy, which Is why I think it needs to change if BO is to accomplish their long term goal of millions living and working in space in the first place.

P.S - I know this kind of thing may come off a controversial but please don't down-vote simply becasue you disagree with my opinion. Instead please give me some substance as to why you disagree in the form of a comment, Thank you.

Also - While the timeline is agonizingly slow I applaud BO for making their first orbital rocket borderline Super Heavy. Since that will likely make scaling up to New Armstrong much easier.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/bb36lq/unpopular_opinion_gradatium_ferociter_is_not/

BlueOrigin,"&gt;**Reusing rocket upper stages**. Blue Origin is [considering](https://spacenews.com/blue-origin-studying-repurposing-of-new-glenn-upper-stages/) repurposing the upper stages of their upcoming New Glenn rocket for use in orbit, possibly as habitats. (Development of [New Glenn](https://www.blueorigin.com/new-glenn/) remains on schedule for launch in 2021.) A group consisting of NanoRacks, SSL, and ULA has also [studied repurposing orbital rocket bodies](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/space-flight/nasa-funds-partnership-to-explore-making-space-habitats-out-of-used-rocket-fuel-tanks) as part of NASA's [NextSTEP](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nextstep-partnerships-develop-ground-prototypes) program. That proposal would involve an Atlas 5 upper stage refitted with life support and attached to the ISS or another station. Repurposing of upper stages in orbit makes sense when considering the energies involved with returning them to the ground for reuse. An upper stage may be moving at up to 8 km/s, compared to \~2 km/s for returning first stage boosters. Decelerating for reentry at those speeds requires a large amount of fuel, heat shielding, or both. The Space Shuttle and SpaceX's proposed Starship are examples of upper stages that return to Earth for reuse using heat shields (or hypothetically “[transpirational cooling](https://www.businessinsider.com/spacex-starship-bleeding-transpirational-atmospheric-reentry-system-challenges-2019-2)” in the case of Starship).

BlueOrigin,"   Some Blue Origin employees visited our school recently and I struck up a conversation with one of their representatives about their long term plans for human spaceflight.
   She didn't go into too much detail (as per company policy) but she did drop some interesting details to me personally. She made it very clear to me that Blue Origin believes vehemently in heavily researching and developing technologies before implementing them, and when researching technologies and architectures their main priority is how much something can be scaled.
   
   After prefacing her statement with that, she then added something very interesting, though I'm paraphrasing this is essentially what she had said to me ""Crew Capsules, parachute landing, pusher abort. Those things are just as scale able as Propulsive landing of the Booster stage on New Glenn"". 

   I took that to mean that something like the crew capsule and abort system on New Shepherd will likely be scaled up to 7 meters in diameter to match New Glenn to carry people (10-15) into orbit and potentially this could even be scaled up to New Armstrong which (assuming 12-15 meter diameter) would allow for something like 30-50 people to go into orbit, making the prospect of having millions of people living and working in space not too far fetched.

   Despite what this representative told me, I remember hearing somewhere that the capsule design doesn't scale very well past a certain diameter (~5m or so) Is there any truth to that and If so why does Blue see this as the best option for manned spaceflight going into the future at larger scales?

BlueOrigin,"   I can't stop thinking about how much of an impact Jeff Bezos and his company will have on our future as a space faring civilization. While we might still be in the barnstorming phase of commercial spaceflight now with New Shepherd's suborbital flights and development on their first orbital heavy class launcher New Glenn. The simple difference in scale between New Shepherd and New Glenn leaves no doubt in my mind that whatever comes after New Glenn (New Armstrong and others perhaps) will be on an equivalently grander scale.

  I started thinking about how Blue Origin could build the ultimate Cis-lunar transportation network and I think I was able to boil it down to a few main modular components. With just six main components Blue Origin could kick start a vast Cis-lunar infrastructure that would allow for Bezos's large scale entrepreneurship in space as well as things like in space manufacturing, mining and construction. All these things will eventually be needed for the millions living and working in space followed by their trillion+ descendants.

   *Component 1 ; The Rocket booster*

The first component would be a first stage booster, similar but not totally like the one on New Glenn. Aside from being powered by liquid methane and liquid oxygen all other similarities to new Glenn would be purely aesthetic in nature. This booster would be far bigger than New Glenn's probably between 12-15 meters in core diameter and possibly larger at the base to accommodate more engine bells. I expect it to be powered by a next generation methane powered engine (perhaps Be-5). I expect that this booster will be prohibitively large to allow for barge landings out in the ocean. Because of it's size I expect this booster to instead preform a boost-back burn and return to the launch site so that money is saved and turnaround times are quickened.

*Component 2 ; The reusable orbit shuttle*

Launched atop the booster I imagine a vehicle very similar to SpaceX's BFR in most respects, however, this is not an interplanetary spaceship but rather a reusable shuttle designed to launch up to 200 tonnes of payload as well as dozens of crew and passengers into a low earth orbit. How it will re-enter and be reused is anyone's guess, but I tend to think of a vehicle that is 12-15 meters wide/ Cylindrical with a side mounted heat shield and aero control surfaces for re-entry as well as propulsive landing ""because it scaled very well -Jeff Bezos"". For commonality with refueling and space based infrastructure I expect this vehicle to be hydrogen powered, although there is a 30% payload sacrifice. The orbit shuttle now has commonality in refueling and manufacturing with other components in this Cis-lunarr transportation system.

   *Component 3 ; The space tug*

   This hydrogen powered stage is built on earth but launched into LEO by the Orbit shuttle. It is completely space proofed with ample amounts of insulation as well as simplified engine plumbing to allow for less maintenance and less wear and tear on the engines. Weather it's taking a satellite from LEO to GEO or picking up crew and cargo from LEO to take to a Low lunar orbit. This jumbo sized hydrogen powered space tug can do it.

   *Component 4 ; Lunar Ascent/Descent tug*

Very much similar to the Space tug with a lower fuel capacity and a shorter overall length along with modified avionics and landing struts. This vehicle picks up cargo/Crew modules from the Space Tug and takes them down to the lunar surface to be offloaded by crane and have new things stacked on to be taken and linked up with a space tug in lunar orbit.

    *Component 5 ; the fuel tank*

This fuel tank module would allow for rocket fuel to be transported around Cis-lunar space since it would hook up to the front of the tug stage and could be docked with other tanks to assemble fuel depots in LEO, EML-1,2,4,5, or even in LLO. Tanks would be fairly simple autogeneously pressurized Hydrolox tanks with heavy insulation to prevent boil off as well as power hookups for refrigeration and pressure regulation.

   *Component 6 ; Crew Cargo module*

Cylindrical modules that could be launched attached to the front of a tug stage and subsequently to a lunar descent stage, capable of carrying either cargo or crew.

BlueOrigin,"   Gateway foundation website; https://gatewayspaceport.com/the-gateway/

   Many of you have probably heard of the gateway foundation. A retired cargo 747 pilot by the name of John Blincow. He started the gateway foundation about 5 years ago with the express hope of building rotating space station/ spaceports in LEO, to provide humanity with it's first serious pieces of space infrastructure. The only problem here is funding. The gateway foundation in my mind has good intentions but their funding scheme is suspiciously reminiscent of Mars One. It's essentially a private lottery in where people pay for a shot at an all expense paid trip to the station/ Spaceport, though there is vast evidence to suggest that they are legitimate (Having engineers/ aerospace professionals employed by their non-profit as well as talks with SpaceX/ Thales Alenia... ect) I don't believe the private lottery idea will work for the amount of funding that they need. Which is why I think blue origin would be a really good sponsor for them. Blue Origin wants to send tourists into LEO aboard New Glenn, but where do they expect to have those tourists stay once they're are up there? Blue Origin could use wings specializing in Space Station design and orbital construction and manufacturing. After all space tourism and orbital manufacturing are the main long term goals for BO and Bezos as a whole, why not put them under the wing of blue and provide them with some financing?

BlueOrigin,"How does the world respond to an operational New Shepard? I personally believe that space tourism even of a limited suborbital kind is going to completely change how we think about what is possible in space. Particularly I think it is going to show the industry that you can make money off of human space flight and open the floodgates to VC money and investor interest in things like space hotels, orbital transport, and space advertising.

My only evidence for why I think this is so is that we have seen this before. I remember going to conferences back in 2012/2013 where seasoned industry veterans and space cadets alike thought that commercial satellite launch was a nonstarter and that something like SpaceX was an anomaly caused by a particularly passionate billionaire. Fast forward to today and there is a ton of VC money being thrown at launch startups like Relativity, Firefly, and Vector. I think this is in part due to the fact that the success of SpaceX as a commercial launch company showed to the world that this is an industry you can be successful in and lowered the financial risk in many people’s minds.

I totally understand that the small launcher boom is also fueled by the rise of small satellites and mega constellations. I would also add that in this domain a lot of heavy lifting had to be done by early entrants like Planet Labs and Skybox to convince the world that there was money to be made.

Do you think that Blue Origin (and virgin galactic’s) decades of investment in space tourism will cause a similar paradigm shift? Will this make it easier for companies like NanoRacks, Axiom, Space Adventures and Bigelow to find the funding they need to execute on their business plans?

BlueOrigin,"   Blue Origin has now been testing New Shepherd for almost 4 years, they have now had 10 successful test flights, with the booster ever being able to land during the in-flight abort test. So far things have been progressing well and they now have a class of new shepherd that is fully capable of flying humans, yet Jeff Foust recently tweeted that the current goal at BO for flying humans in by the end of this year (meaning 2019). My question is what more does BO have to do before flying paying customers on New Shepherd, perhaps 2 more flights? 1) an uncrewed dress rehersal of the crewed flight operations and profile (NS-11, NET May 2019). Then perhaps a test flight with trained test pilots. (NS-12, NET August 2019), then perhaps NS-13 would be the first flight with paying customers, possibly NET November 2019?

BlueOrigin,"   I've lately been caught up in thinking about what the long term goals of Blue Origin are and how they might facilitate and achieve these goals. In comparison to SpaceX I see them as having a more linear development path whereas I see Blue Origin going for an exponential development path (similar to amazon, Bezos; ""While our competitors are looking 3-5 years ahead we are looking 7 years ahead"") In where things move slow in the beginning but eventually they reach a hockey-sticks curve and start accelerating faster and further than anyone would have originally realized. 

   This is what I see happening with Blue Origin, while the first 20 years might seem slow I see a point (perhaps when New Glenn starts maturing [mid 20's]) When Blue begins a period of exponential growth and expansion in their space operations, perhaps in the late 20's or early 30's right about this time I expect New Armstrong will make it's debut and I think it could be something far more than we might initially expect, look at the scale difference between New Shepherd and New Glenn as a predictor of this trend.

   I recently had some speculation about what New Armstrong could be and I'd like to share that with everybody here, not only is it more than we might expect but I believe that this vision fits Bezos's vision like a glove. New Armstrong in my idea is 4 Things, a system and not just a super heavy class launch vehicle. This system is centered on four main parts, a methalox booster stage, a LEO shuttle, a large station transfer station in LEO, and a lunar shuttle. 

   Allow me to explain why this model fits Bezos's vision so well.
 
   What good is sending tourists into space if they have nowhere to go? a large transfer station would give tourists riding on Blue Origin rockets a place to go, and it would also allow for two other vital things besides tourism, a place to store fuel for outbound lunar shuttles, and a transfer point for logistics. Lunar bound payloads could be offloaded in LEO transferred to a Lunar shuttle that has been fully fueled and sent there without having to do this all at once.
   
   Bezos has expressed the importance of building vital infrastructure for smaller space entrepreneurship, a station would give these entrepreneurs a place to do their work as well as a port to operate out of. The booster stage of the New Armstrong system would be similar to New Glenn's booster stage merely scaled up, my guess is that is will be somewhere in the 10-12 meter diameter range and because of it's size will preform a boost back burn to return directly to the launch site rather than landing on a ship like New Glenn. The next part of the system would be the LEO and Lunar Shuttles, In general they would have much in common but also many key differences, They would both be cylindrical in shape and be built on the same assembly lines with the same tooling but would serve rather different functions. The LEO shuttle would be fitted with a heat shield as well as several dynamic control surfaces for rentry and landing (much like BFR) I would also expect this vehicle to use a vacuum version of BE-4 Becuase higher thrust for launches to LEO is better for minimizing gravity losses, The lunar shuttle on the other hand would be very different. The lunar shuttle would launch on top of the booster but would never come back to land on earth ever again, instead it would dock and rendezvous with the LEO transfer station where it would be refueled and sent on trans lunar injection to land at a moon base. The lunar shuttle would have approximately the same shape as the LEO shuttle, perhaps a little longer due to the lesser density of it's hydrogen fuel, but would have no heatsheild and permanently fixed landing legs, all in all a simpler vehicle. After completing it's mission on the moon it would be refueled there from the water ice at the poles and insert itself back into LEO propulsively where it would dock with the transfer station and get ready to return to the moon. All in all this system would develop many of Blues skills including, In space construction (for the transfer station) Re-entry and landing capabilities from the LEO shuttle, Water ice mining and Lunar Ops for the lunar shuttle as well as in general boulstering the backbone of a space economy through transport infrastructure on a level we have never before seen in the past. 

   To sum up all I've said, I think Blue origin will make New Armstrong dedicated to infrastructure rather than just as a traditional launch vehicle for customers to help fulfill their long term vision, they will also IMO focus a division of the company on space stations and in space construction and manufacturing, so as to one day have the skills to build they giant space habitats that Jeff Bezos is so fond of.

BlueOrigin,"I’m hoping some current employees might have some advice about what attire might be desirable and appropriate for an interviewee to wear. This is for an interview in Kent, if that makes a difference.

He’s spending a lot of time preparing for his presentation, so I’m pushing for (worrying about?) making sure he looks sharp, and I want to make sure we’re heading in a good direction in that regard. We’re both kind of idiots when it comes to fashion.

Sorry if this is a stupid thing to ask. He tends toward liking to fit in, and I don’t want him to be so starkly differently dressed than those around him that he gets distracted by it at all during his interview.

Thanks for any advice!",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/akkl0x/blue_origin_company_culture_question_husband/
BlueOrigin,"   Clearly part of Jeff Bezos's motivation for founding Blue Origin was Gerard Oneill's ""High frontier"" concept of Cislunar and eventually most of the solar system's space being populated with giant rotating space megastrucutres in where humans could have access to much more habitable space than being confined to earth. Supplemented by the mining of asteroids, the solar system could eventually support trillions of humans. My question is however about the social and economic consequences of this plan.

   Of course early on in the construction of these rotating megastructures, rents on these space colonies will likely be quite high as the cost of getting into space will be far less than it is now, but still not as cheap as airline travel or something comparable, My question is this. What is to prevent an Elysium type situation from occurring in where the wealthiest of earths population decides to leave for these rotating megastrcutures and the poor are left on earth?

   Surely nothing good could come from this, and I could only imagine that the situation on earth would degrade further, with capital investment leaving as well as a higher proportion of people living in poverty, Earth wouldn't be preserved nearly as much as Jeff Bezos had hoped, in fact the situation kind of reminds me of Blade Runner, earth suffers degradation because the wealthy and well off have left for the off-world colonies.

""We will be producing dozens of BE-4 engines""

A plan to refurbish and reopen a historic Shuttle and Saturn V test stand

[Governor Key Ivey statement at the Blue Origin Groundbreaking Ceremony](https://twitter.com/GovernorKayIvey/status/1088819511174856704)  

"" This $200-million-dollar investment will create 300+ jobs for our people""

[ULA statement](https://twitter.com/ulalaunch/status/1088829505962160128) definitely has a meme potential!

&amp;#x200B;

An investment comparable to New Glenn factory in Florida($250-million). An important milestone for Blue and ULA. 12-18 months to start producing engines.

BE-4 is supposed to complete its development this year, with new engine coming to West Texas. Can't wait for 100% thrust burn.

The most exciting news to come out of this is that Blue is in final negotiations with NASA to perform engine testing at a stand at Marshall previously used for Saturn V and Shuttle engines. 

We are being spoiled lately with this avalanche of news :D Makes this sub alive.

BlueOrigin,"Couldn't find published weight of New Sheppard so did a calculation to see if I could estimate it.

Looking at data from today's NS-10 launch, it accelerated 13.4 ft/s\^2 early on in the flight between the 10 and 15 sec marks, roughly 110 ft/s - 43 ft/s, so 110-43 / 5 = 13.4

It claims 110,000 lbf of Thrust, so 110,000 lbf - (m\*32ft/s\^2) = m\*13.4 ft/s\^2 (resulting force)

Solve for m = 77,533 lbs.

Customer | Experiment Details
:-:|:-:
Carthage College Space Sciences Program |The Modal Propellant Gauging experiment led by Dr. Kevin Crosby is a joint effort with the NASA Kennedy Space Center Cryogenics Laboratory. It demonstrates a way to measure fuel levels in microgravity by using sound waves.
Controlled Dynamics Inc. | The Vibration Isolation Platform (VIP) aims to separate payloads from the normally occurring vibrations experienced during spaceflight. The payload led by Dr. Scott Green allows researchers to have a clear understanding of microgravity’s effects on their research results.
Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab | On its second flight with Blue, the EM Field experiment will observe and collect data on the naturally occurring electromagnetic fields both inside and outside New Shepard during the launch. Principal Investigator Dr. Todd Smith will use success of this experiment to determine how global measurements of the Earth’s electromagnetic field can be conducted in the future.
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center | Cooling tightly-packed electronics onboard a spacecraft can be challenging, and many solutions have not been able to undergo robust testing. Principal Investigator Franklin Robinson will test one of these solutions in his Flow Boiling in Microgap Coolers experiment.
NASA Johnson Space Center |  On its third flight on New Shepard, the Suborbital Flight Experiment Monitor-2 (SFEM-2) led by Dr. Katy Hurlbert will analyze various aspects of the flight environment during New Shepard’s mission profile, measuring cabin pressure, temperature, CO2, acoustic conditions, acceleration and more. The data collected will help future researchers on New Shepard design the most effective experiments for the vehicle.
Purdue University | Dr. Steven Collicott’s payload looks at Zero-Gravity Green Propellant Management Technology, which aims to help advance the use of a safer and more environmentally friendly rocket propellant by better understanding the fuel’s behavior in microgravity.
University of Central Florida | Two teams led by Dr. Josh Colwell and Dr. Addie Dove both have planetary science payloads on NS-10. The Collisions Into Dust Experiment (COLLIDE) aims to understand how dust particles react after surface contact during exploration missions to places such as the Moon, Mars and asteroids. The Collection of Regolith Experiment (CORE) addresses the unique challenge of collecting and analyzing material samples in microgravity.
University of Florida | Dr. Rob Ferl and Dr. Anna-Lisa Paul are adapting technology designed for the ISS to suborbital uses with their experiment, Validating Telemetric Imaging Hardware for Crew-Assisted and Crew-Autonomous Biological Imaging in Suborbital Applications. By recalibrating the way data is collected, the experiment will enable more biological research on suborbital missions.

It was originally an Engineer II position, but I only have 4 years experience (they were asking for minimum of 5), so they are going to have to modify it to an Engineer I position. 

He said “don’t worry about the title right now, just have a number in your head that you expect for salary. Blue won’t do that for you, we want you to tell us what you want, and go from there.” 

I’ve never had this happen before, I’ve worked at TI and Raytheon where there is zero negotiation on salary. 

I ran the numbers on it, and to have the same standard of living in Seattle as I have now, I’d have to make 115k. I also would like to get a liiiitle bit of a bump, so I thought I’d ask for 118k. Does this sound reasonable?

BlueOrigin,"So, it's my understanding that the long term goal for blue origin is to move heavy industry to the moon. My interpretation of this is that they want to move manufacturing of the machinery that makes our civilisation tick, but pollutes the world, to space, so things like steel production or even manufactured goods like cars, planes and ships. If that is the case, what is the plan for getting those goods back to earth from space? Re-entry is hard and I would have thought sending mega-tons of payload in through the atmosphere would generate a lot of heat, which could even go some way to offset the environmental gains. Something like a space elevator would presumably solve this problem, but are they working on that long term?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/a0214o/long_term_plans_for_blue_origin/

BlueOrigin,"Latley I've been thinking of the potential options that Blue Origin has for setting up their lunar base. Blue moon is nice but the cargo capacity is limited to about 4,500 kg to the lunar surface because the second stage has to send the mass of itself as well as the blue moon lander into LEO before TLI, therefore most of the fuel and ergo most of the payload capacity. However what if New Glenn's second stage was refueled in LEO? Has anyone here done the calcuations of how much mass could be thrown on TLI?

* BFR style ; Integrated seconds stage/payload faring with hatch style payload release mechanism and side mounted heat sheild. Along with adequite aero control surfaces for manuvering in the atomosphere. 

* Kistler/Early falcon 9 concept style ; Front mounted or possibly an inflatible heatsheild design on the front of the second stage.

* Horizontal landing style, Intergrated second stage &amp; spaceplane that delivers the payload to target orbit, re-enters the atomosphere, autonoumously flies back to a runway.

BlueOrigin,"I'm curious if Blue themselves will find the research and design for habitats or if they will be more apt to use a 3rd party. It seems from how we can see their progression with both rockets and now blue moon, that they will likely develop some early habitats first. Potentially they could use New Shepard's suborbital flights to gather data on micro gravity and see how their environmental systems hold up. Using this information they could develop smaller habitats and then look to build larger ones. With Bezo's plan for trillions in the solar system I would think that he would keep R&amp;D of space habitats in house.

BlueOrigin,"Currently the partially reusable New Glenn has a payload capacity of about 45 tonnes to LEO in the first iteration of it's operational design.
 As we've seen with the Falcon 9 however the payload capacity and overall power through Engine upgrades/ stretches of the launch vehicle itself have yielded a near doubling of initial payload capacity, for example Block I of falcon 9 had a fully expendable maximum payload to LEO of about 10 metric tonnes. (which likely would have been less than half of that if Space X had attempted partial re usability on block I) In only eight years we have seen Falcon 9's expendable payload capacity double to around 22 metric tonnes to LEO, with all this being said my question is this.
      Could we potentially see New Glenn's partially reusable payload capacity grow in a similar fashion in the years after it starts flying? Could it approach 90 metric tonnes to LEO and potentially compete with BFR before the advent of New Armstrong? 
What do you guys think?

BlueOrigin," Hi There,  


Moving heavy industry from Earth into space is at the core of Blue Origin’s mission. The future will be better for our children – and our children’s children – if we use space to benefit life on Earth and enable millions of people to live and work in space.  
   
The next logical step in this path is a return to the Moon. To do this we need reusable access to the lunar surface and its resources. We’re in the conceptual design phase of a large lunar lander that will provide that access called Blue Moon.  
   
We are not alone in our drive to return to the Moon, and there have been some exciting updates this week at the 69th Annual International Astronautical Congress in Bremen, Germany.  
   
Blue has joined leading space companies and agencies to support the creation of [The Moon Race](https://blueorigin.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ca4c14684ac1af3f1219b4382&amp;id=7cef927497&amp;e=ea7008150c), a non-profit working to launch a competition for teams looking for a ride to the lunar surface. The goal is consistent with our aim to land large payloads on the Moon that can access and utilize the resources found there. We’re supporting this initiative, along with ESA, Airbus, and other entities seeking to foster the next generation of lunar exploration – with Blue Moon and New Glenn.  
   
We’re also excited to announce a collaboration with OHB SE and MT Aerospace on a [future Blue Moon mission](https://blueorigin.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ca4c14684ac1af3f1219b4382&amp;id=3a78b71971&amp;e=ea7008150c).

BlueOrigin,"I did some pixel-counting of the latest [New Glenn image here](https://i.imgur.com/C0wsvbr.png), and this is what I came up with: 

Old 3 stage New Glenn: 313 ft
Old 2 stage New Glenn: 270 ft
Latest version of New Glenn: 308 ft

Essentially, the booster is the same height and the second stage got a lot bigger. 

Old second stage: 36 ft
New Second stage: 53 ft

So basically, the new second stage has a volume 50% larger than the old second stage. Given that methalox is around 2.25 times as dense as hydrolox fuel, though, this represents much less fuel mass. However, hydrolox gives around 20% more ISP than methalox, and less fuel mass means the booster doesn't have as much to lift, so ends up producing a higher DeltaV. I'm not sure exactly what the overall performance change is, but I'd guess the new hydrolox second stage is probably similar in capability to the old methalox upper stage. So in all likelihood, despite the rocket getting larger, it hasn't dramatically changed in payload capabilities from the old 2-stage version.

BlueOrigin,"   For a company that's stated goal is to have ""Millions of people living and working in space,"" I am quite frankly amazed that We haven't heard so much peep about an actual crewed orbital craft that could start actually transporting people into LEO. Despite the current lack of information, there are three things that we do know for certain 

* New Glenn will have a Crew Vehicle. 
- The hostess of NS-8 on the Blue Origin Livestream mentioned that people who had flown on new Shepard would be given first priority for tickets aboard New Glenn's crew vehicle into orbital space.
* BO is targeting crewed New Glenn launches to start between 2025-2026.
- Rob Meyerson has previously stated that he thinks that New Glenn will begin orbital manned launches is about 7-8 years, While seemingly less ambitious than some of the timeframes that SpaceX has ascribed to their BFR, I think that this is a decidedly more realistic timeframe when you're orbital rocket hasn't even flown yet.

* Blue Origin did already design a Manned Orbit-class Crew Vehicle but it has most certainly changed radically from that initial design. 
- Back around 2011, BO submitted a Commercial Crew proposal to NASA that involved a small (Dragon V2, Cst-100 sized) Biconic Crew Vehicle that would be capable of carrying at most a crew of 7 into LEO, While this was their proposed crew vehicle at the time things have most certainly changed, at the time BO's First Orbital rocket was supposed to be similar in capacity to earlier iterations of Falcon 9 or the lesser powered configurations of the Atlas 5, Now BO is planning a Super-Heavy Lift (According to Robert Zubrin likely close to 60 metric tonnes to LEO with new dual Be-3u upper stage) launch vehicle as it's first Orbital Rocket with a 7m diameter to boot, so the design has most certainly been changed to accommodate these updated parameters. 

      I Personally Speculate that the design teams at BO will go one of three ways with their crew vehicle.

* Option 1 ; 7m Integrated upper stage crew vehicle (Similar to BFR)
- Vehicle would have a dry mass of about 30 metric tonnes, and would have it's crew cabin located on top with fuel tanks and engines located directly below along with a side mounted heat-shield and a lifting body re-entry profile, Whether or not BO would resurrect BE-4 vac or just decide to use the BE-3u engine is anybody's guess, but it would no doubt be a smart way to introduce a crew vehicle as well as full upper stage re-use at the same time on New Glenn, assuming that there would also be a cargo version (Again similar to BFR). Their are obvious downsides to this design decision though, Mostly stemming from the fact that the vehicle would need to carry it's heat-shield everywhere it went -which would cut into dry mass, not to mention the need to carry extra re-entry control surfaces as well as one or more sea-level engines for landing propulsively on the surface of the Earth. This vehicle could likely fly 20-30 people into orbit at once and at a lower cost that CST-100 or Dragon 2 (but not likely lower than BFR) since Full re-use would for sure make tourist/ Civilian seats to orbit far cheaper than if the second stage was expended at the end of every launch simply leaving a dead-weight capsule in orbit. If orbital re-fueling was implemented this vehicle could also be used on missions beyond LEO, to Lunar orbit or even to the Lunar surface if the vehicle uses Hydrolox, since it would likely need to re-fuel on the Lunar surface.  

* Option 2 ; 7m Biconic Crew capsule 
- Weighing about 20 metric tonnes, this vehicle would enable a crew of about 20-30 people to go into Orbit and would either propulsively land back on Earth or would land via parachutes and airbags like the New Shepard Capsule or CST-100. It would essentially be a scaled up version of what BO submitted to Nasa in 2011. Since it would be a dead weight payload, it would need to be connected to a in-space tug to go anywhere beyond LEO and the Second stage would have to be recovered by alternate means (say a front mounted heat-shield or a ballute), The main advantage of this vehicle over option 1 is that it would have significantly lower development costs and would be able to be operational sooner after development was initiated.

* Option 3 ; 5m 7-10 person Crew capsule
- Likely weighing less than 10 metric tonnes, this vehicle would not take as much of an advantage of economies of scale as the other two options nor would it be as ground breaking or innovative, but it would be easier to send onto TLI because of it's smaller mass and would likely be more adept for serving the near future crew transport market, ex. ISS replacement or bigelow Ba-330 derived private space stations. It would also be the cheapest option in terms of development cost, for a smaller vehicle it would require a tapered inter-stage since New Glenn has a main body diameter of 7 meters.      
               
    In the end this is just my estimation of what BO might do regarding a crew transport vehicle that will fly on New Glenn, What do you guys think? Comment below and let me know.

BlueOrigin,"Could anybody explain why Spaceflight Now doesn't add BO launches to their launch schedule.

I know they're only tests but Spaceflight Now lists other test flights such as SpaceX crew demo, FH launch etc.

I'm curious as to why they disregard BOs launches?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/916mn4/blue_origin_isnt_added_to_spaceflight_now_launch/
BlueOrigin,"SpaceX substantially improved the performance of Falcon 9 since first launching.  Do you think BO will do the same with NS by increasing the length of the fuel tanks or the power of the BE3?

Some sounding rockets go to altitudes of 1000 km or more, while the current NS goes to just over 100 km.  How much extra value would going to 1000 km offer?

At 1000 km, the earth would take up just 120 degrees of the view vs 160 degrees at 100 km.  That's 33% less - a lot more spacey feel.  Free fall would last 8 minutes longer.  What would that be worth to you?  How much more value would that be for a tourist visit to space?  Would it be enough for you to think, ""Wow, earth is small.  We better take care of this thing and war is just insanity?""

Could the current architecture be modified to increase altitude, somewhat like SpaceX has done with Falcon 9, or would it require a complete redesign with a different engine, more engines, etc?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/913zkj/new_shepard_performance_improvements_what_about/
BlueOrigin,"What is according to Blue Origin the projected sub-orbital market size for let's say the coming decade? Preferably also broken down in industrial/research/tourism contributions.

I'm asking because I've read some books on the New Space industry, but each of their projections vary wildly. Some go from 300 million USD to over 2 billion USD for the coming 5 years.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/90tjyg/projected_suborbital_market_size/

BlueOrigin,"Let's face it.  New Shephard is a gimmick allowed because someone designated a certain altitude as ""space"".  It has almost no value.

New Glenn will be a real launch vehicle, but it won't do anything to bring man to space.  It likely won't substantially beat Falcon 9 or Falcon H on price.  It's good for America and freedom loving people the world over to have redundancy, but it's not worthy of Bezos's ambitions.  

BFR is the only project in motion that will truly advance humanity towards space.  BO needs to get on the bandwagon.  And, truth be told, if BFR succeeds, every other launch vehicle will become antiquated.

This is Blue Origin's 2nd launch of 2018 and 9th launch in total of this suborbital New Shepard type booster and capsule hardware type. Similarly to the last flight of NS-2 last year, this launch will include a test of the escape motor in the crew capsule, unlike the last test of this type, this escape test will not be performed at maxQ but at a much higher altitude. Jeff Bezos mentioned via Twitter; ""We’ll be doing a high-altitude escape motor test — pushing the rocket to its limits,"". These are the final tests that need to be completed before the spacecraft is ready for passenger operation, space.com has noted ""If the test program continues to go well, New Shepard could begin operational flights as early as this year, Blue Origin representatives have said. The company has not publicly revealed how much it will charge for a seat aboard the suborbital vehicle.""

BlueOrigin,"Jeff Bezos says he sells $1bil of Amazon stock every year to fund Blue Origin. So it's yearly budget is $1bil. I was doing some research online and it says that Space X has spend $1bil over the last decade.

BlueOrigin,"Trying to put together some thoughts I've been having for awhile:

I have a hunch that the future of Blue Origin will look like the Apollo Applications Program (AAP). AAP was the original plan for human spaceflight in the 1970s after the Apollo program met its initial goal of landing people on the moon. It was an ambitious program of space stations, large uncrewed platforms, and lunar base construction.  Some features:

-Saturn I for orbital transport, Saturn V for deep space transport
-Habitats derived from Saturn upper stages
-Uprating the Apollo CM to carry 6 astronauts for LEO missions
-Uprating the LEM to take all 3 astronauts to the lunar surface, stay for longer,  and/or act as a temporary base. 
-Cargo only version of the LEM
-converting the LEM ascent stage into a space telescope

It's obvious that one of the main design drivers behind AAP was a desire to reuse as much of the moon landing hardware as possible. NASA was aware even in the mid 60s that R&amp;D funding was going to tail off after Kennedy's goal was met so AAP was conceived as a way to have an ambitious human spaceflight program by leveraging existing investments. As we all know AAP was scrapped by Nixon in favor of the shuttle.

Blue has continuously said that their major focus is rockets. Bob Smith even goes so far as to say that they're a propulsion company at heart. We know that Bezos wants to develop at a minimum three launch vehicles; New Glenn, New Shepard, and New Armstrong, to lower the cost of accessing space. Each of these vehicles represents a significant investment in engines, in manufacturing, and in technical expertise. They are building a giant factory in Florida to support New Glenn and I imagine a similar investment will be made for New Armstrong. Their entire organization seems for the most part geared towards launch vehicles, rocket engines, and capsules.

I've always been skeptical that launch is all that is needed to develop space. Other necessary pieces of infrastructure would include landers, depots, habitats, and servicing craft. My hunch is that if Blue Origin decides to build any of this then commonality with the launch infrastructure is going to be a major design driver. You see this with Blue Moon which tries to utilize New Shepard technology to do a LEM sized lunar lander. If Blue decides to do habitats then they're going to be based off of New Glenn or New Armstrong tankage. Launch vehicles are one of the few space products that are sort of mass-produced whereas habitats, landers, and depots might be one offs for a while. It doesn't make sense to double the size of the company or build a new factory to produce a single habitat module when they can just tap off from the people and tooling they already have.

I could also be totally wrong. SpaceX is right now betting the farm on making breaks with the past. Red Dragon was supposed to be the quickest path to Mars but it has been scrapped in favor of going right for BFR. I've even read articles that for the money it cost to build and the number of years it will be operational (assuming BFR is flying by 2020's) that Falcon Heavy might not have been worth it. Adapting three Falcon-9's into a heavy lift launcher was much harder than it seems and that it might have just been quicker to move to a wider rocket from the start.

Bezos also has more money than God and could probably build his own habitats, depots, and landers from the ground up. ",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/8gchot/blue_origin_applications_program/

* Has BO said anything about the design of this manned orbital Spacecraft that they plan on building?

* Assuming that it is rapidly re-usable do we expect this Spacecraft to be a separate Spacecraft or integrated with the newly announced duel Be-3u upper stage (Kind of like BFR) as a way of developing upper stage re-usability

* What kind of payload/passenger capacity could this 7m spacecraft have?

* Could it have orbital refueling Allowing it to perform TLI burns and send humans/ cargo into cislunar Space?

- If anyone has any information or better insights then I would like to hear it.

BlueOrigin,"   I'm sure that most of the people who follow commercial spaceflight closely are aware that the overall architecture for New Glenn has changed pretty significantly in recent months. 


   Originally the plan for New Glenn was to have a vehicle boasting 3 engine types, a first stage powered by 7 Lox/LCH4 SL Be-4's, a second stage powered by a single Vac Be-4u and an optional thrid stage from GEO &amp; deep space mission that would be powered by a single or possibly multiple Lox/LH2 Be-3u's. As of recently that Architrcture has been radically simplified.   


Instead of using a Lox/LCH4 Be-4U second stage with a single engine  BO has switched to a duel engine Be-3u configuration which uses hydrogen instead of the originally propesed methane fuel. Per this change I was wondering if anyone had done the math to see how New Glenn's preformance has changed, the primary questions that come up in my mind are these.

1. Since Hydrolox is less dense than Metlox, how much has the second stage being stretched to accommodate the new fuel?

2. By how much and in which direction has LEO has LEO payload changed? Although I understand that thrust is now lower, hasn't the upper stage gained like 80s of Isp and not to mention become a lot lighter when fully loaded with fuel and oxidizer my own two cents tells me that LEO payload has increased but IDK for sure.

3. How much has GEO direct insertion payload changed, surely it's increased?

4. How does this affect Blue Origins long-term goals, Does this pivot to Hydrolox for the second stage mean that second stages will be re-used as lunar tugs? How does this affect Blue Origins manned ambitions? Lunar ISRU refueling?

5. How does this affect new Armstrong development, has new Glenn been simplified to allow New Armstrong development to follow sooner so as to compete with BFR?

BlueOrigin,"Hey all, so the ULA development plan is to first upgrade the Centuar from 3m to 5m for use on the Vulcan first stage. Then they will be adding the ACES kit, and then sometime after that SMART for the first stage. The last major item is the XEUS kit for 5m Centuar for all the obvious uses.

My question is given the close relationship with ULA and same fuel type being used on both the NG 3rd stage and the Centaur could we see BO license the ACES and XEUS tech for a BO space tug? 

If so I'd like to see the math on a 7m ACES and XEUS, if any of you are smart enough to math that out I'd appreciate it.

BlueOrigin,"Intro 

* It has previously been stated by Rob Meyerson at Blue origin that they hope to be able to fly humans on New Glenn in ""7-8 years"". If this is true then Blue Origin must be looking to develop a manned capsule capable of transporting Humans to LEO and potentially further. Using what we know I think I have an idea for how initial manned Lunar missions facilitated by blue origin will work.

Step 1 (2024-2025) 

* Blue Origin will launch a number of commercial (probably Bigelow) habitats, radiators, solar panels to build a station at EML-1, after the station is complete it will serve as a joint between the LEO - EML-1 stage of the journey &amp; the EML-1-Lunar surface part of the journey. In addition to the modules, Blue origin will launch several Blue Moon landers to dock with the station so as to provide lunar surface access.

Step 2 (2026-2027) 

* Crew + cargo bound for the moon launch aboard a BO crew capsule into LEO, after the Orbit insertion stage separates the Capsule + New Glenn third stage remain in LEO and orbit a few times before doing a direct injection burn for the EML-1 station, After a few days of coasting the Crew arrive and transfer cargo into the Blue moon lander, where they undock from the station to set up an initial Lunar base with rudimentary ISRU capability. After their mission, they launch aboard the Blue Moon landers and Dock with the EML-1 station once more and transfer their extra hydrolox fuel to the Capsule + NG third stage stack which allows the crew to return to Earth. All subsequent New Glenn Third stages are reused and pick the NG capsule up form LEO and take it to EML-1 where the process is repeated for routine lunar surface access.

BlueOrigin,"So I've been writing a Sci-Fi novel slowly but steadily over the past 3 months or so and takes place in 2068. I have seen where the main character is describing the history of spaceflight and I know for sure that the race Between SpaceX's BFR (Flying since 2024) and Blue Origins New Armstrong (Flying since 2032) is going to be a huge part of this scene.

 Now I've described BFR in great detail in this scene, but to do it justice I would also like to describe New Armstrong is great detail as well, now before you accuse me of engaging in wild speculation I'd just like to say that this is all for fun and I'm not asking for some detailed figures such as TWR for the main engines or Isp, but rather the configuration and rough size of the vehicle.

 Part of me wants to make the fictionalized New Armstrong a Larger scale copycat of the BFR (I.e the, proverbial 747 &amp; a380 of early-mid 21st-century spaceflight) but the other part of me wants to make it something completely different form BFR in terms of how similar the architecture is to what SpaceX is developing.

BlueOrigin,"New Glenn is an amazing vehicle from what is being proposed, In a standard 2 stage configuration with re-using the first stage, it will be able to launch 45,000 kg into a 200 km x 200 km LEO.

 New Glenn also has a key advantage over the SpaceX Falcon series in it has a 7 m x 21 m payload fairing that is far less volume constrained and offers space for some amazing things like the large commercial moon landers, Space tugs, interplanetary probes, Bigelow ba330 habitats, etc. Now 45,000 kg is a lot (about what the Saturn V put on trans-lunar injection) But given the lesser concerns on volume, there are potentially even larger payloads (Airforce orbital weapons/ maybe some private space station parts) that would be in the super heavy class range.

 My question is there any way that the Be-3u hydrolox third stage could be used to allow New Glenn to loft even heavier payloads into LEO (similar to the Saturn V flight profile) while still reusing the first stage. If so then I would be very interested to see how much more than 45,000 kg New Glenn could loft (If anyone would do the math on this they would be a homie to me) and what some potential applications of this could be?

[^Find ^the ^previous ^discussion ^thread ^here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/6sl9gj/official_question_and_discussion_thread/)

Do you have a question about New Shepard tickets?

Do you want to talk about the engineering involved in getting into space?

Are you wondering about the partnership between Blue Origin and ULA? 

#This is the thread for open ended discussion related to Blue Origin, space travel, or space in general!

If you have a question you've been afraid to ask, feel free to post it here!

BlueOrigin,"I'm very excited about BO, but maybe I'm *too* excited for my own good : because the lack of news is excruciating.

Few weeks ago we had footage of the BE-4 testing.  Nothing since.  New Sheppard next flight?  We don't know.  New Glenn production status?  No idea.

It gets frustrating, really.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/7u17zl/isnt_the_lack_of_news_painful/
BlueOrigin,"My personal theory is that Jeff Bezos will host a talk of some kind (maybe at IAC 2022 or 2023) after New Glenn has been flying successfully for 2 years or so. It will include specifications on New Armstrong and a timeline for development, my theory on that is listed below.

* Intended as a direct competitor to SpaceX's BFR for commercial cargo flights to lunar and Mars bases as well as the assembly of space stations in Earth orbit and launching entire satellite constellations all at once.
* 15 - 18-meter diameter
* stack height 100 + meters tall (squatter than new Glenn or BFR)
* Second stage ship with side mounted heatshield (similar to BFR) 6 - 8 methalox (Probably different from BE-4 or BE-2 vacuum engines) with both cargo only and crew only interior configurations.  
* 260-300 tonnes of LEO (Fully reusable)
* 75 + tonnes to GTO (direct insertion)
* 200 + passengers in crew configuration
* 300 - 400 tonnes to Mars (with orbital refueling and cargo loading)
* Launched from LC - 39D (completed by 2030)
* Booster preforms RTLS maneuvers and lands on the launch mount
* Operational by 2030 (7 or 8 years after announcement)

What do you guys think?

* [NOTAM to clear the airspace around the pad](http://tfr.faa.gov/save_pages/detail_7_2605.html)

This is Blue Origin's 1st launch this year and 7th launch in total of this suborbital New Shepard type booster and capsule hardware. This vehicle has never flown before as the previous hardware NS-2 was relieved of it's duties after overcoming an amazing in-flight escape test in October last year.

BlueOrigin,"This is an attempt to gather information about when New Shepard will fly next. Earlier in the year we were told New Shepard would have an unmanned test, then move to test pilots by the end of 2017 and have paying customers in 2018. I have been looking around for info about when the next New Shepard flight will be and this is what I have come up with so far. Feel more then welcome to add anything about the status of New Shepard.  

Here is an older article talking about the expected flights in 2017 https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15105684/blue-origin-new-shepherd-crew-interior-photos-tourist-space

BlueOrigin,"Hello /r/BlueOrigin!

I am a Brooke Owens Fellow Alumni, a Chemical Engineer Graduate from UCSD and a Propulsion Engineer at Virgin Orbit. This past summer, I participated in the Brooke Owens Fellowship Program which offers aerospace internships in engineering, policy, business analysis, venture capital, communications, education, airport operations and more to undergraduate women pursuing careers in the aerospace industry. In addition to internships at the industry's top companies, each Fellow is paired with TWO executive mentors in the aerospace industry, one within her company and one outside of her company. These mentors include two most recent Deputy Administrators of NASA, multiple CEOs, award-winning journalists, astronauts and more. My personal mentor was a veteran of five Space Shuttle flights and seven spacewalks named Scott Parazynski (we are friends on Facebook now!!!!). On top of that, I met 36 intelligent women who shared the same passion as mine: Space.

This fellowship was the best outlet for the aerospace industry and endless opportunities. So please spread the word to benefit other women!
 
The application information can be found on the Brooke Owens Fellowship website. Applications are due December 5th!

BlueOrigin,"It seems unreasonable that a brand new rocket orbital rocket of that power (17 mega newtons) will manage to take off and land on a drone or at KSC successfully. Space X had to try a few times before nailing it, and this was after several years of orbital launches with Falcon 9. This is going to be Blue Origin's first launch with a brand new engine and new fuel, very different flight path and flight characteristics and WAY more thrust.  I think there are good engineers working hard on this rocket however it IS rocket science, something is bound to go wrong with all that new hardware.


Also I didn't see any cold gas thrusters in the launch concept video which are pretty much essential if you want to turn the booster around at 120ish km like SpaceX have been doing. Fins just aren't going to cut it up there.
Also could a booster that size land on such flimsy landing legs?

BlueOrigin,"[New Glenn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTEhohh6eYk&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I promised a revised analysis a while back and only just now getting around to posting it.  

[This version](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhbaivoynsw160q/NG%20Design%20Round%202.xlsx?dl=0) has the same basic assumptions as the previous post [(found here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/60llhq/new_glenn_mass_estimates_based_on_payload_to/). Given the limited information available on the New Glenn and BE-4 I had to use some of the basic equations and some external sources ([Braeunig.us](http://braeunig.us/space/index.htm) is a great resource for simple stuff like this) to find a rocket design that closely matches the published measurements.

I limited the T/W range to a much smaller series (1.25-1.37) and that seems to agree within 6m of the height estimates of 82m for the two stage and 95m for the three stage configurations, so I am declaring victory! I also used hemispherical dome volumes on the tanks which I believe is the reason I actually achieved the height estimates for the given payload mass.

Tab {2.4} TW=1.25, actually matches height within 0.8m and 0.2m of the two and three stage versions, respectively. Worth checking out.

Comments, questions, fears, and are welcome.

Enjoy!

[edit] Fogot something of note, if my stage masses are accurate (mostly the hydrolox S3) then a single NG launch is capable of boosting the Orion to TLI. IMO that is a brilliant strategy, allow yourself to back up SLS and it gives you an in with NASA and certain Congress critters who may be persuaded to fund some development/missions for a Blue Moon lander

BlueOrigin,"Hi guys, I just watched the New Glenn introduction video and  got quite hyped, a very sleek looking rocket with an interesting take on reusability and commercial space flight.
Nevertheless, I got some questions:

1) Why did Blue Origin choose to land New Glenn just like New Shepard, with a Burn-to-hover and a subsequent landing instead of landing directly without a hover burn?
Isn't that inefficient? I would guess maybe with a hover the landing can be more precise?

2)Is there more data for BO rockets in general and New Glenn in particular? As an engineering student, I dig them datasheets.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/6lkbz2/new_glenn_questions/

BlueOrigin,"Review: https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blue-origin-logo.jpg

So in the above image we see 5 arcs which we know the first 2 map to:
3.6 km/s  = Reusable suborbital rocket system named New Shepard.
9.5 km/s = Reusable LEO/GEO orbital rocket system named New Glenn.

The next 2 here are logical assumptions: 
13 km/s = Reusable Cis-lunar rocket named New Armstrong.
19 km/s = Reusable Mars/Asteroid belt scale rocket named TBD. (I assume we will know this name in the next decade)

And my wild guess: 
20 km/s = Reusable intraplanetary spaceship system named TBD 

The reason I assume the 5th vehicle will not be a rocket is because the delta-v is only 1km/s more. This implies a radically different type of vehicle with slightly more delta-v. Robert Heinlein says 10km/s is ""halfway to anywhere"".  Well that means 20 km/s from LEO is therefore ""anywhere and back"".  See:
https://i.imgur.com/SqdzxzF.png
And visualized a better way:
https://i.stack.imgur.com/ebf6D.png
This vehicle will not land on the surface of hard bodies, it will be a true spaceship which is built in space and refueled there. This will be the minimally viable ""trans oceanic"" cargo vehicle of the solar system.
Basically it will fly along the ""tops"" of the gravity wells in the above image. 

My baseline ""spaceship"" is something like this:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus-X
I assume Jeff will do something much larger and interesting. 
Anyone care to take a stab at size/capabilities of rockets 3 and 4, and spaceship 5?

Thanks!

BlueOrigin,"I get the feeling that the internet in general (and reddit) believes that SpaceX's ITS is a much surer bet and will fly much sooner than any comparable BO rocket (such as New Armstrong), but I'm of the opposite opinion. While I *really* hope both of these projects are successful, I do think BO has some major advantages in resources and scheduling, given the present situation. 

&amp;nbsp;

We all know a great many things will be required for SpaceX's ITS and BO's New Armstrong, but in my view the big ones are:

&amp;nbsp;

*1. Lots of money for development*. In this respect, BO is in much better shape, as they have all the money they need thanks to Bezos, while SpaceX does not have the same level of resources. 

&amp;nbsp;

*2. R&amp;D*. It seems likely that new Armstrong will be cheaper, faster, and less complicated to build than ITS (with much less R&amp;D), as it will probably be a scaled-up version of New Glenn (same engines, similar general design). ITS, on the other hand, is a good deal more complex and ambitious while also being quite different from Falcon 9/Heavy. 

&amp;nbsp;

*3. An entirely new factory, built either at the launch location, or on the coast* (due to booster diameter preventing movement by road). BO will have a factory meeting these requirements soon (albeit not tooled for New Armstrong, but certainly capable of it), while SpaceX doesn't even have plans for a facility like this yet.

&amp;nbsp;

I think once New Glenn is flying around 2020 ([per Jeff Bezos](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/blue-origin-releases-details-of-its-monster-orbital-rocket/)), New Armstrong will be a short step forward for BO. They'll have the funds, the factory space, and most of the R&amp;D done. If we give them a generous three years to hammer out New Glenn booster landings and get the final iteration of the New Glenn design done, by 2023 or so they'll probably have the data to start New Armstrong construction, and be flying around 2025. 

&amp;nbsp;

SpaceX's ITS schedule is much harder to quantify. I believe Elon himself mentioned ITS construction might take a decade or so at the current rate, which seems like a fairly realistic number. While SpaceX is working hard to get the R&amp;D out of the way, they don't have the money right now to start building/acquiring the factory facilities required for ITS, and they can't use the ones they already have. They're working on getting the money, but in order to do so they have to focus on getting commercial operations rolling, and that's been somewhat slower than they originally forecast. Once SpaceX actually starts executing on a plan to acquire ITS factory space, I think we're around 4 years out from ITS booster flights, and 5 years out from ITS flights. But that's the key. Until we hear more about actual ITS factory space, ITS is just a paper rocket (albeit backed up by more and more data and R&amp;D as time goes on). 

&amp;nbsp;

On the other hand, BO has been moving dirt for awhile, and will soon have a setup capable of bending metal for New Armstrong (minus some tooling, although I expect a lot of commonality between New Glenn and New Armstrong). Consequently, if I had to bet on one of these rockets, I would place a much higher probability on New Armstrong eventually launching than ITS, and probably sooner (by at least a year or two). 

&amp;nbsp;

Another thing that would be interesting to quantify is how much SpaceX's schedule delays are affected by their very high employee turnover rate. In my experience, high turnover tends to lead to project delays due to lack of continuity and experience. BO appears to have much lower turnover than SpaceX, and seems to be generally well-liked as a career company (as opposed to SpaceX, which has bad long-term employee retention rates). This may reduce BO's risk of project delays. 

&amp;nbsp;

BlueOrigin,"[New Glenn](https://youtu.be/BTEhohh6eYk)

[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8mzqw6disijbfyc/NG%20Design.xlsx?dl=0) are my initial estimations for the New Glenn launch mass and potential as a vehicle for exploration. I want to start this discussion on the /r/BlueOrigin community, I hope to update some of this in the coming months as more information becomes available. 


Let me start by saying the only guarantee I can make is these numbers WILL be wrong. The known parameters used to arrive at these estimations are: 

(1) Sea level thrust of the BE-4

(2) Number of engines in S1 and S2

(3) Chamber pressure of the BE-4

(4) (Old) comments by Bezos on the thrust and Isp for the BE-3U

(5) Payload to LEO and GTO for the 2 Stage configuration

(6) Landing technique and some comparison data from the F9 gathered on /r/spacex

(7) A slide rule, and some good old armchair rocket science (okay maybe not the slide rule)


I did not attempt to estimate the mass of those “Stingray Strakes” on the S1, I did use the video to estimate the wing area assuming a 7m diameter core I got roughly 35m^2 which is roughly equivalent to the wing area of an F/A-18. I generally have preferred the 1,300mt for this analysis, it yields a higher T/W ratio for the 2 stage variant which allows for a faster burning of the S1 propellant (better for landing maneuvers) and still has enough payload margin to launch a relatively large (nearly S-IVb class) hydrolox S3 with little determent to the performance of the lower stages. In this configuration, the 350mt S2 easily allows for S1 recovery with sufficient landing propellant margin and still meet the quoted 45mt to LEO, 13mt to GTO numbers. As with others I had some trouble with getting the length figured out, I am beginning to wonder if the 7m diameter is referring to the engine base diameter and the tank diameter is actually ~6m, even that doesn't solve the problem though.




-*Tab {1}* outlines the engine performance numbers used in the analysis

-*Tabs {2}* outline the total vehicle performance with payload to LEO and GTO for different launch mass estimates (labelled based on the T/W at launch) 

-*Tab {3}* allows **YOU** to mess with the launch mass number and find your own optimization points for the two stage variant from the engine specs page and the stage mass variants

-*Tabs {4}* outline the general performance for the 3 stage variant based on the 1,300mt vehicle outlined in Tab {2}. Tab {3} is further divided into two different S3 masses (85mt, and 100mt). Interestingly enough if you just require the S3 to perform the TLI burn and use onboard payload propulsion to perform LOI you can lift 30mt direct to TLI, space station modules, Orion and landers are all within reach

-*Tab {5}* IMHO is the most important of all this, it outlines the potential for the NG to launch substantial propellant loads to LEO for mating with heavy loads already in orbit and launch them to important destinations like the moon, mars or gas giants in as little at **TWO** launches.




I surmise (even prior to NG announcement) that vehicles capable of 40-50mt to LEO are the minimum required to begin large scale exploration, colonization and expansion into space. For many reasons these vehicles are more than capable of carrying average commercial payloads for revenue to cover much of the infrastructure costs, they have sufficient mass to make them durable and capable of reuse and they have margins necessary to provide large propellant deliveries to LEO. Under the analysis performed NG shows an excellent capacity for enabling both heavy deep space launches and normal LEO services.


Let me know what you think, opinions and recommendations are encouraged. Anyone is welcome to use this for other work just add my name in there somewhere

**TL;DR** Two stage New Glenn has a 1,300t launch mass (sans payload) and is capable of lifting 45mt to LEO, 13mt to GTO. With the addition of a large hydrolox S3 (~100mt) it is capable of lifting 15mt directly to low lunar orbit and back to earth return trajectory in a single launch. Using a two stage to launch a 45t to LEO and a 3 stage to launch the S3 (no payload) you can directly place 45mt into low lunar orbit. In short, **what can Blue do for you?**",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/60llhq/new_glenn_mass_estimates_based_on_payload_to/

BlueOrigin,"Another mailing list update from Blue Origin: 

&gt; Although the BE-4 turbopump is smaller than your refrigerator, it generates 70,000 horsepower from a turbine running at nearly 19,000 revolutions per minute that pumps cryogenic propellants to pressures just under 5,000 pounds per square inch. To react the forces generated by the rotating turbine and impellers inside the pump, production rocket turbopumps to date have used traditional ball and roller bearings. For BE-4, we’re doing something different – we’re using hydrostatic bearings.

&gt; A hydrostatic bearing relies on a fluid film supplied by a high-pressure source to provide support for the shaft and cause it to float without contacting the static structure except at startup and shutdown. The BE-4 main turbopump uses hydrostatic journal bearings for radial support and hydrostatic axial bearings to carry axial thrust. The system is bootstrapped. The high pressure fluid films for the bearings are supplied by the propellants themselves – liquefied natural gas and liquid oxygen – tapped off from the pump discharge flows.

&gt; Material selection is a critical consideration for this approach, as there is physical contact between the bearing surfaces during the start transient before the fluid film is fully established and during the shutdown transient as the fluid film dissipates. With lab-scale tests and full-scale bearing rig tests using actual pump hardware, we evaluated over 20 material combinations in over a hundred tests, leading to our baseline material and coating choices.

&gt; Extensive rotordynamic and computational fluid dynamics analyses have shown the feasibility of this design, and recent powerpack tests confirmed that this approach works during the startup and shutdown transients – the most critical phases. The shaft orbit plot below shows that the turbopump lifts off smoothly and centers during a typical start transient, demonstrating a smooth ride on a film of propellant.

&gt; Why do we go to all this trouble instead of just using traditional bearings? Engine life. We’re relentlessly focused on reusability, and properly designed hydrostatic bearings offer the potential for longer engine life without refurbishment. This is one of the many engineering decisions we’ve made that we hope will lead to reusability – not just in principle – but to practical, operational reusability. If “reusability” requires significant refurbishment, inspection, and re-validation between flights, then it simply won’t lead to the far lower launch costs we need to achieve our vision of millions of people living and working in space.

&gt; We’ll keep you up to date as our testing progresses in the coming weeks.

BlueOrigin,"I've seen a lot of people putting New Glenn between Delta IV Heavy and Falcon Heavy in terms of payload mass capability. This was my initial thought, but it turns out that the [Falcon Heavy 54,400 kg lift](http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities) capacity is for expendable launches. According to Musk, [the reusable mode Falcon Heavy will have 30-40% less lift capacity](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/726559990480150528) which puts the payload mass to LEO between 32,640 kg to 38,080 kg. The New Glenn, which will have 45,000 kg to LEO for reusable launches, can therefore **deliver about 18% to 38% more payload to LEO than FH**.

I don't think that NG will be offered as an expendable rocket, but if it were, using the 30%-40% ratio, NG would be able to launch 64,285 kg to 75,000kg to LEO. My guess would be that the true number is closer to the lower end since it looks like NG is not really designed to fly as expendable, for example the Falcon rocket family can fly without legs and gridfins but NG has integrated legs and would likely not remove the strakes and actuated fins.

Doing the same calculation for GTO, NG is slightly below Delta IV but much higher than FH**. Also keep in mind that this is the two stage variant of NG and the three stage will likely have extremely high performance for GTO compared to similar launch vehicles. Those are numbers that have not been released.

To summarize:



 | Delta IV Heavy | Falcon Heavy (reusable) | New Glenn (reusable, 2 stage variant | Falcon Heavy (expendable) | New Glenn (expendable, two stage variant)
---|---|----|----|----|----
Mass to LEO (kg) | 28,790 | 32,640 - 38,080 | 45,000 | 54,400 | 64,285 - 75,000
Mass to GTO (kg)| 14,220 | 8,000**| 13,000 | 22,200 | 18,570 - 21,670 

**As far as the FH, I'm not sure what the exact mass to GTO is for reusable launches. The SpaceX site says 8.0 mT for ""Standard Payment Plan"" so I assume this is the reusable mode. If we do the calculation based on 30% to 40% reduction, the mass to GTO would be  13,320 kg to 15,540 kg.


Down the road, purchasing an expendable FH would only make sense for payloads between 45,000kg and 54,000 kg (unless expendable FH is cheaper than reusable NG which is unlikely). Even then, three stage variant of NG would likely be a better option given the much larger fairing volume and a much cheaper (my personal prediction) launch cost since NG will still be reusable and does not involve parallel staging.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/5ygtaa/new_glenn_payload_mass_to_leo_is_18_38_greater/

BlueOrigin,"&gt;Robert Goddard’s first rockets used compressed gas to force the liquid propellants into the engine thrust chambers. While simple in design and a logical starting point, he quickly realized the limitations with this approach: it requires thick-walled heavy propellant tanks and limits the engine’s chamber pressure and performance, both of which limit payload capacity. The answer was turbopumps. Store the propellants in low-pressure light tanks, and then pump the propellants up to high pressure just ahead of injection into the main chamber.

&gt;For even more performance, you can add one or more boost pumps ahead of the main pumps. We’ve done that on the oxidizer side of our BE-4 engine. Our Ox Boost Pump (OBP) design leverages 3-D additive manufacturing to make many of the key components. The housing is a single printed aluminum part and all of the stages of the hydraulic turbine are printed from Monel, a nickel alloy. This manufacturing approach allows the integration of complex internal flow passages in the housing that would be much more difficult to make using conventional methods. The turbine nozzles and rotors are also 3-D printed and require minimum machining to achieve the required fits.

&gt;The OBP was first demonstrated last year in testing, where we validated its interaction with a main pump. The second iteration of the OBP for BE-4 is now in test. We’ve also just finished assembly of the unit that we’ll install for the first all-up BE-4 engine test.

&gt;We’ll keep you posted on how our BE-4 powerpack and engine testing progresses.

BlueOrigin,"I'm struggling to understand the benefits of using New Shepard as a Space Tourism vehicle in Blue Origin's stated goal of advancing spaceflight. I don't see how it's a profitable endeavor. 

If we assume Blue Origin is going to sell tickets at $250,000, like Virgin Galatic, you'd have to launch ~75X in a year to generate the same revenue of 1 orbital flight. 

Since NS' capsule carries 6 people, you can figure they'll sell 5 of those seats. You'd want at least 1 employee on board to ensure everything is proceeding safely and the passengers are behaving. 

That gives you a revenue of $1.25M per flight.

The going rate for an orbital flight these days is between $80M and $120M depending upon services.

I see them losing money on NS tourism but gaining experience. I see this as helping to fund their institutional knowledge as they learn how to have a high launch cadence. I see this as them learning how to carry passengers safely. If they can put a few million in their pocket while they are learning, great. But, I don't see this as a long-term profitable endeavor. 

They can gain all the same knowledge as they work to recover New Glenn from the first few launches.

BlueOrigin,"Thought it would be nice to have a predictions thread. Will be interesting to see what we get right and what we get wrong.

I'm predicting 7-8 flights of New Shephard next year. 

Also first manned flight in the second half of the year, but no paying passengers yet. However I think they'll have some paid scientific payloads though",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/5imrru/predictions_for_2017/

BlueOrigin,"I thought [multiple engine types multiplied costs](http://www.airspacemag.com/space/is-spacex-changing-the-rocket-equation-132285884/)?
&gt;Musk says that overhead starts with how the launch vehicle is designed. The workhorse Atlas V, for example, used for everything from planetary probes to spy satellites, employs up to three kinds of rockets, each tailored to a specific phase of flight. The Russian-built RD-180 first- stage engines burn a highly refined form of kerosene called RP1. Optional solid-fuel strap-on boosters can provide additional thrust at liftoff, and a liquid hydrogen upper stage takes over in the final phase of flight. Using three kinds of rockets in the same vehicle may optimize its performance, but at a price: “To a first-order approximation, you’ve just tripled your factory costs and all your operational costs,” says Musk.

&gt;Instead, from the very beginning, SpaceX designed its Falcon rockets with commonality in mind. Both of Falcon 9’s stages are powered by RP1 and liquid oxygen, so only one type of engine is required.

Also, there's this. Unless New Glenn will have a reusable third stage, there might be a problem of [the rocket being less cost-optimized for reusability](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/20qjvz/former_arianespace_chief_says_spacex_has/cg67rq6/).

&gt;Because for these rockets [i.e. Atlas V] the first stage is the cheapest part, most of the cost of the vehicle is in the upper stages since they use LOX/LH2, advanced materials, advanced engines, and so on. The RL-10 engine, for example, which is used on both the Delta and Atlas, costs nearly $40 million alone*. Even if the 1st stage of the Delta IV or Atlas 5 is provided for free from a magic leprechaun the cost of the rocket isn't going to get lower than the cost of the RL-10 plus the rest of the 2nd stage construction. Making the cheapest part of the vehicle cheaper just don't help overall cost of the rocket.

~~*while an expendable Falcon 9 v1.2 is $60 million for about twice the payload of an Atlas V 401~~

edit: you get the idea, $40 million is a significant fraction of the cost of a Falcon 9 launch.

It's good that the ""commonality"" philosophy is being applied with the two-stage version of the New Glenn (methane/liquid oxygen BE-4 engine used on both stages), and a third hydrolox stage *does* indeed have advantages for sending payloads on high-energy trajectories beyond Earth orbit. But is it worth it when you have the risk that comes with additional separation events, as well as more manufacturing and operational costs, and potentially less cost savings during reuse unless all stages turn out to be reusable? And recovering three stages would be a pain operationally if the launch market got to the point where rapid reusability is needed.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/5hf3by/about_new_glenns_hydrolox_third_stage/

BlueOrigin,"You've probably seen [my post asking if anyone had been to a Blue Origin launch before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/comments/55rhig/anyone_here_ever_watched_a_blue_origin_launch/)  Well, thanks to the great feedback from /u/SPACEVINE, a cool boss that let me take a day off with little notice, and a supporting spouse, I was able to view today's launch in person.

I originally started out with a rambling, stream of consciousness telling of my experience.  For the sake of brevity, I decided instead to break it down into a couple of things.  The 'mechanics' of watching a Blue launch and the experience.

Prior to space vine's info I had found nothing about watching a Blue launch.  The company doesn't say anything about it, and it still such a small, new company not many people come out.  Van Horn is pretty middle-of-nowhere West Texas.  Most of the people there were from neighboring communities, maybe 2 hours away at most.  Once you get off I-10 in Van Horn there's a well maintained state highway that heads north.  After about 15 minutes or so of zooming around mountains and up and down hills you come around the bend and see the valley were Blue does the launches.  The VPF was easily seen off in the distance.  As I got closer you'd start to see 1 or two cars pulled off here and there on the side of the road.  I ended up parking near the main gate.  There's a decent sized gravel pull-off on the side that fit probably 10-20 cars.  I was told that if you went much further up the road you'd encounter the Sheriff.   The road wasn't closed but they were telling people that beyond that point they couldn't stop on the side of the road for some number of miles.  I had a cheap pair of 10X50 binos I had bought on the way down.  You could easily see the rocket and launchpad.  The landing pad was a bit further north and I had to strain a bit to see the landed rocket, but it's doable.  The people that showed up were friendly and from a wide variety of ages/backgrounds.  It was pretty informal.  Someone (Blue?  TXDOT?) had obviously put in that gravel pullout, but otherwise the whole thing seemed pretty hands off.  Blue's there to do its thing, and hey if you want to watch, good luck, you're basically on your own.  Also for most of the ride I had no cell signal with Verizon, but it sounded like a couple of people had a decent connection, so YMMV.

Now the experience.  If you haven't seen a launch, I highly recommend it.  Seeing it on video is one thing, but feeling the thunderous sound of the rocket (even a 'small' one like NS) is quite the experience.  Same with the sonic boom from the rocket just as it landed on the pad in the distance.  The sense of scale afforded by being there in person provides perspective.  Seeing the rocket fall in video is one thing, watching is screaming out of the heavens at some ungodly speed with your own eyes is quite another.

All in all, I'd say it was worth the drive (how much, depends on you) and would recommend it to anyone.  I'm guessing as things ramp up it might be busier/crazier out there, so if you are able I'd say go to one sooner than later.

One of the people at the spot I parked was dating someone at Blue.  One of the more interesting things they shared it it sounded like there was very little refurb of the vehicle between launches.  It sounded like they basically patch up the TPS on the bottom, as needed, and it's pretty much ready to go again.  (I'd love to see one where they launch 2-3 times in a day).  It sounded like they'll start flying people in the next year, and there's an internal lottery amongst employees about who gets to go on some of those first test launches.  When I asked if they had heard anything about BE-4, I was told they're aiming for January, but I don't know how old their info is.

If anyone has any questions, I'll try and answer them. I wanted to experience the launch, not be distracted by recording/photographing it.  But I did take some pics.  I'll post some later, if any are decent.

UPDATE:  [Posted an album online](http://imgur.com/a/D6tXv)  Keep the following things in mind:  I'm not a pro photographer.  Any pics taken during launch were basically me slamming down my binoculars and snapping a few quick shots, then watching the launch again.   I purposefully didn't edit/crop most of the pics, so you'd have a sense of perspective and get a feel for what it was like to watch it in person (should you decide too). My binos were able to get in a bit closer than my 200mm zoom, but you get the idea of what it looks like to see it in person from a distance...",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/563x7o/my_experience_of_watching_a_blue_origin_launch_in/

BlueOrigin,"I was considering driving a few hours out to Van Horn to see the launch on ~~Thursday~~ Wednesday. However, information about public viewing of launches is non-existent, especially compared to other established launch sites.  Before I potentially wasted my time I was hoping someone might have had experience so I know its a ""Oh yeah, you can see it off in the distance from the side of the road..."" or a ""No good, they close off the highway 20 miles in either direction"" kind of thing.  I've never seen a launch so I'm excited at the possibility, and I figured if you get a chance to see a rocket launch, what better than one where it's expected to blow up at some point.  I'm also dropping a note to BO, but I don't know if they'll get back to me in time.

UPDATE:  I decided to roll the dice.  After many hours of late, late night driving I'm in the area.  Much to my surprise and disappointment when I went to get a feel for the rest of the drive in the morning to the area near the launch site I now notice a note on Google Maps saying the road is closed, and pretty well before the area I had intended to drive to to view the launch = \  The Texas DOT site lists no road closures in the county...  I guess we'll see what happens in the morning, but I hope to see at least *something*.

**Launch Mission:**

&gt;We’ll be doing our in-flight escape test with the same reusable New Shepard booster that we’ve already flown four times. About 45 seconds after liftoff at about 16,000 feet, we’ll intentionally command escape. Redundant separation systems will sever the crew capsule from the booster at the same time we ignite the escape motor. You can get an idea of what will happen in this [animation](https://youtu.be/N5i-f-D_A-M). The escape motor will vector thrust to steer the capsule to the side, out of the booster’s path. The high acceleration portion of the escape lasts less than two seconds, but by then the capsule will be hundreds of feet away and diverging quickly. It will traverse twice through transonic velocities – the most difficult control region – during the acceleration burn and subsequent deceleration. The capsule will then coast, stabilized by reaction control thrusters, until it starts descending. Its three drogue parachutes will deploy near the top of its flight path, followed shortly thereafter by main parachutes.

TL;DR: At approx T+45s and 16,000ft an anomoly signal will be sent and the capsule will be jettisoned. A solid motor will be triggered and will push the capsule away from the booster at great speed.


**The Booster:**

* Due to the nature of the test it is unlikely the booster will survive, which is why we're not going to do landing bingo. Sorry.

&gt;This test will probably destroy the booster. The booster was never designed to survive an in-flight escape. The capsule escape motor will slam the booster with 70,000 pounds of off-axis force delivered by searing hot exhaust. The aerodynamic shape of the vehicle quickly changes from leading with the capsule to leading with the ring fin, and this all happens at maximum dynamic pressure. Nevertheless, the booster is very robust and our Monte Carlo simulations show there’s some chance we can fly through these disturbances and recover the booster.

* Feel free to post to your heart's content but please follow the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueOrigin/about/rules/).
* Remember things don't always go to plan, space is hard so (unplanned) failures are possible or as Jeff put it on the last flight:

&gt;As always, this is a development test flight and anything can happen.

Rob Meyerson, President of Blue Origin will be making a presentation at the 67th International Astronautical Congress from Guadalajara, Mexico. The presentation will discuss Blue Origin's long and short term goals as well as past successes and failures, hopefully the talk will enlighten us as to some of the finer points of New Glenn, as well as some of New Shepard's next steps towards being human rated and on into being used for space tourism flights. I'd like to say we'll hear a little about New Armstrong but I don't want to jinx anything!

**Where?**

This year the IAC is being held at Guadalajara, Mexico.

**What is IAC?**

&gt; Every year, the International Astronautical Federation together with the International Academy of Astronautics and theInternational Institute of Space Law (IISL), holds the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) which is hosted by one of the national society members of the IAF.

&gt; They are an annual meeting of the actors in the discipline of space, and are generally held in late September or early October. They consist of plenary sessions, lectures and meetings. The IAC is attended by the agency heads and senior executives of the world's space agencies.

Ok we're not going to pretend this speech isn't being a little over-shadowed by Spacex's mars announcement, ([which can be followed on their sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/54itnx/rspacex_mars_architecture_announcementiac_2016/)) but don't be too hasty in thinking that Blue Origin don't have anything too major up their sleeve.

I believe the naming system is based on the furthest location a human passenger could go. So while the ""New Glenn"" could send robots to other locations it will be limited to only sending humans to LEO. This makes the ""New Armstrong"" the human lunar development rocket. 

According to my eyes the road map says: 
3 km/s = New Shepard, 
9.5 km/s = New Glenn, 
15 km/s =  New Armstrong, 
19 km/s = ???, 
20 km/s = ???, 

Using some delta V maps (please link your favorite) Ceres looks about 19 km/s away. 
The mystery is why is the 2nd unknown rocket has only a 1 km/s improvement? 
I think it is because the first 4 will be designed to launch from Earth where the 4th represents an end state ""in space only"" transportation system in line with the following quote: 

""When it comes to space, I see it as my job, I'm building infrastructure the hard way. I'm using my resources to put in place heavy lifting infrastructure so the next generation of people can have a dynamic, entrepreneurial explosion into space.""

If you are going to have millions of people living and working in space I think this represents the ship which will fly between the infrastructure, most importantly fuel depots refueled from the ice in the asteroid belt. 

Thoughts?

BlueOrigin,"If Robert Zubrin's [comment is to be believed](https://twitter.com/robert_zubrin/status/775365975034114049), New Glenn should have an expendable payload to LEO of about 70 tonnes. While I'd expect it to be used in reusable mode most of the time, what payloads would justify using a rocket that big in fully expendable mode?

Here are two that I could think of:

1. Launching Europa Clipper to Jupiter. An Atlas 5 launch would take take 6 years to get to Jupiter. SLS could get the probe to Jupiter in less than 2 years using a higher energy direct transfer orbit. Is there an orbit available that would allow you to split the difference, and direct launch to Jupiter a bit slower than SLS, but without the multiple flybys a smaller Altas-V class of launcher would need?
2. The smallest version of the Bigalow 2100 station was guesstimated by Bigalow to mass in at about 70 tonnes. This is right at the limit of what NG would be capable of, but if it were possible I think this would be worthy of an expendable flight!

Can you think of any other missions that would warrant an expendable launch?

Mmmmmmm. Bigalow-2100...",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/52gx18/new_glenn_is_a_big_rocket_proposed_uses/

BlueOrigin,"&gt;Our next flight is going to be dramatic, no matter how it ends.

&gt;Like Mercury, Apollo, and Soyuz, New Shepard has an escape system that can quickly propel the crew capsule to safety if a problem is detected with the booster. Our escape system, however, is configured differently from those earlier designs. They mounted the escape motor on a tower above the capsule – a “tractor” configuration – the escape motor would pull the capsule away from a failing booster. But because a capsule cannot reenter Earth’s atmosphere or deploy parachutes with a tower on top, the tower, along with the escape motor, must be jettisoned on every flight – even the nominal flights. Expending an escape motor on every flight drives up costs significantly. Further, the jettison operation is itself safety critical. Failure to jettison the tower is catastrophic.

&gt;The New Shepard escape motor pushes rather than pulls and is mounted underneath the capsule rather than on a tower. There is no jettison operation. On a nominal mission, the escape motor is not expended and can be flown again and again. We’ve already tested our pusher escape system, including many ground tests and a successful [pad escape test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l8aQ3hQyVs), but this upcoming flight will be our toughest test yet. We’ll intentionally trigger an escape in flight and at the most stressing condition: maximum dynamic pressure through transonic velocities.

&gt;Capsule in-flight escape testing was last done during the Apollo program. From 1964-1966, in-flight escape tests were performed with Apollo simulator capsules using an expendable booster called the [Little Joe II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqeJzItldSQ). We’ll be doing our in-flight escape test with the same reusable New Shepard booster that we’ve already flown four times. About 45 seconds after liftoff at about 16,000 feet, we’ll intentionally command escape. Redundant separation systems will sever the crew capsule from the booster at the same time we ignite the escape motor. You can get an idea of what will happen in this [animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5i-f-D_A-M). The escape motor will vector thrust to steer the capsule to the side, out of the booster’s path. The high acceleration portion of the escape lasts less than two seconds, but by then the capsule will be hundreds of feet away and diverging quickly. It will traverse twice through transonic velocities – the most difficult control region – during the acceleration burn and subsequent deceleration. The capsule will then coast, stabilized by reaction control thrusters, until it starts descending. Its three drogue parachutes will deploy near the top of its flight path, followed shortly thereafter by main parachutes.

&gt;What of the booster? It’s the first ever rocket booster to fly above the Karman line into space and then land vertically upon the Earth. And it’s done so multiple times. We’d really like to retire it after this test and put it in a museum. Sadly, that’s not likely. This test will probably destroy the booster. The booster was never designed to survive an in-flight escape. The capsule escape motor will slam the booster with 70,000 pounds of off-axis force delivered by searing hot exhaust. The aerodynamic shape of the vehicle quickly changes from leading with the capsule to leading with the ring fin, and this all happens at maximum dynamic pressure. Nevertheless, the booster is very robust and our Monte Carlo simulations show there’s some chance we can fly through these disturbances and recover the booster. If the booster does manage to survive this flight – its fifth – we will in fact reward it for its service with a retirement party and put it in a museum. In the more likely event that we end up sacrificing the booster in service of this test, it will still have most of its propellant on board at the time escape is triggered, and its impact with the desert floor will be most impressive.

&gt;The test should be in the first part of October, and we’ll webcast it live for your viewing pleasure. Details to come.

&gt;If someone forwarded this email to you and you’d like to subscribe to get these updates yourself, you can do so [here](https://www.blueorigin.com/interested). In my next email update, I hope to give you a sneak peek of the orbital vehicle we’ve been working on for the last few years.

BlueOrigin,"&gt;On our most recent flight, we performed a test to prove the Crew Capsule could safely land with only two of its three parachutes open. On a nominal flight with all three parachutes deployed, the capsule descends at about 16 mph before firing a retrorocket just a few feet above the ground.  This retrorocket firing is what creates the large cloud of dust you see just before the capsule lands, and slows the capsule down to 3 mph before it touches the ground. This last bit of speed is absorbed by a ring shaped crushable bumper made of aluminum honeycomb material mounted on the bottom of the capsule. The ring is made of eight segments.

&gt;On this last mission, with one chute intentionally failed, the capsule was descending at 23 mph before firing its retrorocket. The retrorocket took out most of that velocity, and the crushable ring did the rest of the job. Below, you can see a couple of pictures of the crushable after the flight test. The first picture shows it mounted under the vehicle after we lifted it off the ground post-flight. The second picture shows a side view of the eight segments after we removed them from the vehicle. Even with one chute out, the crushable barely crushed. When new, the crushable is about 5.5 inches high and can crush down to less than one inch high, providing a constant deceleration force as it crushes. After the mission, the crushable was still over 5 inches high along nearly the entire circumference of the ring.

&gt;We’ve designed the capsule to ensure astronaut safety not just for a failure of one parachute, but even for a failure of two parachutes. In addition to the retrorocket system and the crushable ring, there is an energy absorbing mechanism mounted underneath each seat.

BlueOrigin,"&gt;We broke ground on our orbital vehicle manufacturing site in Florida.

&gt;The 750,000 square foot rocket factory is custom-built from the ground up to accommodate manufacturing, processing, integration and testing. Among other things, the facility hosts large scale friction stir welding and automated composite processing equipment. All of the vehicle will be manufactured in this facility except for the engines. Initial BE-4 engine production will occur at our Kent facility while we conduct a site selection process later this year for a larger engine production facility to accommodate higher production rates.

&gt;I’ve included some photos that will give you an idea of what the vehicle manufacturing facility will look like in December 2017 when it’s complete.

&gt;It’s exciting to see the bulldozers in action--we’re clearing the way for the production of a reusable fleet of orbital vehicles that we will launch and land, again and again.

BlueOrigin,"I gathered some data based on the speed and time from the live webcast from flight 4 of the New Shepard. Assumed the rocket is going just straight up and down, which is a simplification, but accurate enough for this application.    
[Data vs altitude](http://i.imgur.com/aRFDjsO.jpg)  
[Data vs time](http://i.imgur.com/hJuBeoB.jpg)  
  
Some observations:  
- Initial TWR of about 1,5.     
- Thrust is reduced 15sec before MECO, likely to achieve passing the Karman line with maximum fuel reserves for landing.  
- 'Weightless'/free-falling time of about 200sec, or 3min 20sec.  
- Significant effect of atmosphere on acceleration only occurs well below 40km altitude.  
- The 15sec of 5mph constant landing speed costs somewhat below 150m/s delta-v extra compared to a suicide burn.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/4pwyf1/analysis_of_telemetry_from_webcast_from_launch_4/

* We will be updating this area with relevant information as the launch coverage progresses.
* Feel free to post to your heart's content but be civil, this is not a place for arguments, rude comments or content not related to the launch. We will ban anyone whom we feel are not complying to these simple rules.
* We will be hosting a thread after the launch on what you thought of this thread, and what you think we could change/do better, just to gauge what people want to see next time. Please keep these sort of comments until that thread has opened (unless it's something that needs to be done immediately).

To maintain a fast pace, we’ve elected over the past years to invest heavily in key machines, tooling and people for the production of BE-4 so we can control critical processes in-house.

BlueOrigin,"You might remember the Apollo 15 capsule had one parachute fail during its return to earth prompting the recovery ship USS Okinawa to radio to Worden, Irwin and Scott in the Command Module “You have a streamed chute. Stand by for a hard impact.”

 [Parachute failure on Apollo 15](http://imgur.com/5idkzwC)

A parachute failure is a credible scenario in even the most carefully designed recovery system, so a robust vehicle needs to accommodate that possibility through redundancies and margin designed and built into each subsystem that protects the astronauts during landing. The New Shepard crew capsule is designed to safely land the crew even in the event of a parachute failure.

As I mentioned briefly in the last e-mail, we’re about to do that test. In addition to redundant parachutes, the crew capsule is equipped with a two-stage crushable structure that absorbs landing loads, along with seats that use a passive energy absorbing mechanism to reduce peak loads to the occupant. As an added measure of redundancy, the crew capsule is equipped with a “retro rocket” propulsive system that activates just a few feet above the ground to lower the velocity to approximately 3 ft/sec at touchdown. This final maneuver causes the dust cloud you can see when the crew capsule lands.

We’re planning to demonstrate the redundancies built into the capsule on this re-flight of the vehicle by intentionally failing one drogue and one main parachute during descent. This should occur around 7 ½ minutes into the flight at an altitude of 24,000 feet.

Our other goals for this mission include continuing to learn about our reusable architecture by actually reusing it (this will be the fourth flight of the same hardware), further demonstrating the predictability and repeatability of vehicle performance, and executing pre-planned flight control maneuvers on the booster and crew capsule via fin deflections, TVC deflections and RCS firings to observe system response in order to reduce modeling uncertainties.

We’ll provide a heads up when we know the flight date, but it will likely be before the end of the month.

BlueOrigin,"Back in March, we shared with you our efforts on building two new test cells to further support risk reduction testing on the BE-4.  We began the construction of these additional facilities in October last year and we’ve just commissioned the first of these cells last week.  This test cell is pressure fed and supports the development of the preburner start and ignition sequence timing that will be used on the upcoming full scale powerpack test campaign.  As mentioned in a prior email, one of the many benefits of a privately funded engine development is that we can make and implement decisions quickly. We made the decision to build these two new test cells as a team in a 10 minute discussion.  Less than three weeks later we were pouring concrete and now we have an operating pressure fed test cell 7 months later. Private funding and rapid decision making are two of the reasons why the BE-4 is the fastest path to eliminate U.S. dependence on the Russian-made RD-180.


[Commissioned Preburner Test Facility (thanks /u/old_sellsword)](http://i.imgur.com/hbc8UzT.jpg)

This new pressure fed facility is capable of supporting full scale preburner risk reduction.  If you look closely, you’ll see we already have the 14 inch diameter test article integrated into the facility ready for initial testing.  More on that as we have it.
 
We’re also finishing our mission planning for another flight of New Shepard, which will be our fourth flight with this vehicle.  One of the fundamental tenets of Blue Origin is that the safest vehicle is one that is robust and well understood.  Each successive mission affords us the opportunity to learn and improve our vehicles and their modeling.  We have stepwise expanded our flight envelope on the booster and crew capsule on every mission. On our most recent flight, we performed maneuvers on the crew capsule to help characterize its aerodynamics and reduce our model uncertainties. On this next mission, we’ll execute additional maneuvers on both the crew capsule and the booster to increase our vehicle characterization and modeling accuracy.
 
On this upcoming mission we also plan to stress the crew capsule by landing with an intentionally failed parachute, demonstrating our ability to safely handle that failure scenario.  It promises to be an exciting demonstration.  We’ll be sharing more with you about the upcoming mission as we have it.

BlueOrigin,"Another newsletter update from Blue Origin:

&gt;In the BE-4 preburner, a very small portion of the engine’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel mixes and burns with all of the engine’s liquid oxygen to produce hot gaseous oxygen, which is used to drive the turbine and spin the turbopumps. Oxygen and LNG burn stoichiometrically above 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and temperatures of about 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit or more are needed to reliably ignite and sustain the reaction. No practical turbine materials would survive at that temperature, especially in a reusable application. To resolve this, the BE-4 preburner mixes unburned oxygen into the burned gas stream to dilute the combustion gases and reduce the overall temperature to about 700 degrees Fahrenheit. If this mixing process isn’t meticulously designed, hot spots can persist in the stream and limit turbine life.

&gt;To design the preburner to provide uniform temperature, we use 3-D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to model the LNG and liquid oxygen combustion process. CFD predicts fluid behavior by solving the Navier-Stokes equations to describe how the velocity, pressure, temperature, and density of a moving fluid relate. CFD of reacting flows, especially those that also involve a phase change, is much, much harder because it must also solve chemistry along with state equations. Combusting CFD has only become practical with recent advances in chemical physics models and computing power.

&gt;*[Combusting CFD modeling of the BE-4 preburner shows temperature distribution of hot gaseous oxygen entering the turbine](https://i.imgur.com/ufeI0wv.png)*

&gt;To date, we’ve completed several million core hours of CFD modeling of BE-4 combustion processes. Modeling of the preburner shows good mixing and temperature uniformity upstream of the turbine. The combustion and temperature data we’ve gathered in our subscale testing correlate with our CFD predictions and show that our preburner sizing and injector element design meet design requirements. The ability to do combusting CFD simulations doesn’t eliminate the need for rigorous testing, but it will significantly shorten the test-fail-fix loop on the test stand. We’ll keep you updated.

BlueOrigin,"A while ago I read the book ""The Rocket Company"" by Patrick Stiennon, in which he describes a two-stage reusable rocket. He explains that the first stage of the rocket (DH-1) launched straight up more or less (though there was some adjustments due to the spin of the Earth) and afterwards landed, vertically, at the launch pad.

Having read that and having seen the landings of the New Shepherd launch vehicle, my question is would the straight up vertical launch profile make sense for the Very Big Brother? 

I ask this because it seems like by going with this ""vertical only"" launch for the first stage of the Very Big Brother, Blue Origin could then leverage the technology and experience gained from New Shepherd and achieve the reusability of the first stage more quickly (I'm assuming the first stage of the Very Big Brother will be derived from New Shepherd)? 

On the other hand I guess there is a disadvantage here in that the first stage would not contribute much to the horizontal acceleration needed to get to orbital velocity... I'm wondering what others think about this?

BlueOrigin,"I just got this email from Blue Origin:

&gt;BE-4 testing is well underway at Blue Origin. To date, we’ve completed more than 170 staged-combustion tests – including 51 starts on a single regeneratively cooled chamber and nozzle. The preburner performed flawlessly and the main injector consistently demonstrated performance at the high end of our predictions, giving us confidence that we’ll get good specific impulse when we go to full-scale engine testing later this year.

&gt;We’re building two new test cells. The first is a high-pressure cell that lets us run short-duration, full-scale isolated preburner tests. We’ll use this cell to refine the ignition sequence and understand the start transients. The second is another full engine test cell. Having two full engine test positions will allow us to further increase the testing pace.

&gt;One of the many benefits of a privately funded engine development is that we can make and implement decisions quickly. Building these two new test cells is a $10 million commitment, and we as a team made the decision to move forward in 10 minutes.  Less than three weeks later we were pouring the needed three-foot thick foundations. Private funding and rapid decision making are two of the reasons why the BE-4 is the fastest path to eliminate U.S. dependence on the Russian-made RD-180.

BlueOrigin,"....and that the New Shepard is actually a reusable second stage being developed and tested in plain sight with the space tourism angle just a cover?

The choice of hydrogen screams upper-stage and I think we've all guessed that the engines would see double duty in the future on a second stage but....  what if we're looking at the stage itself?

The bottom of the rocket is round, could they be planning on integrating a heat shield so it could survive re-entry from orbital speeds after delivering a payload?  A bigger methalox first stage is probably in the works based on tumors surrounding the BE-4, if they can R&amp;D landing experience on the smaller second stage first, it will probably help when the bigger rocket's ready to fly.

BlueOrigin,"I'm no expert, just trying to calculate/guess the capability of the potential Blue Origin LVs with some maths.

**The engines.**

BE-4 Engine

 * Mass(guess based on RD-191): 2.7t

 * Thrust SL 2400 kN

 * estimating ISP of 315s sl and 340s vac

BE-3U Engine:

 *  mass guess (from J-2 ) 1.2t

 *  Thrust Vacuum 760 kN

 *  vac isp estimate 450s


Also i'm going to use the gross approximation that if a vehicle has adequate TWR, and 9500 m/s Delta-V, then it can reach LEO.

**BB - Single BE-4 Vehicle:**
__________________
Max vehicle mass: 212t (1.15 liftoff TWR)

The vehicle can't possibly weight more then this including payload knowing the thrust of the BE-4

=calculate starting with initial S2 TWR of ~0.68 (relatively typical for a 2nd stage)=
total S2 mass = 95t + fairings/payload

S2 dry fraction = 0.084, based of S-IVB 

upper dry mass 8.0 t

prop mass 87t


g*450*log((95.0+7)/(8+7)) = 8459m/s

this of course leaves about a mass of 109t for S1, this is pretty ridiculous, but would almost work except the there'd be too much of the early flight with low TWR, we'll come back to this.

**Try something more realistic for a single engine booster. try starting with initial S2 TWR of ~1 (unusually high)**

670/g = 68.3, lets say S2 mass is 60, so with average payload initial TWR should be around 1.

S2 total mass: 60t

upper dry mass fraction  0.0917 (S-IVB)

Dry: 5.5

Prop mass 54.5

figures where arrived at by looking at the dry/wet mass of the Saturn V 3rd stage, so approximate, but probably not too far off.

max TWR = 670/(g*(5.5)) = 12.4, this is pretty high with minimal payload, though the deep throttling of the BE-3 makes this less of a problem.
Delta-V(with 10t payload) = g * 450 * log((60+10)/(5.5+10)) = 6653 m/s

diameter 3.6m - height 24.5m

Stage 1:

Total Mass: 152

Dry mass fraction:0.111 based on on DIV-H

Dry mass: 16.9t 

Delta-V(10t payload ) = 2864 m/s
flight TWR 1.15 - ~2.9


g * 327.5 * log(212/(16.9+60.0+10)) + g * 450 * log((60+10)/(5.5+10)) = 9517 m/s

Result: a more normally proportioned LV, but with a High TWR upper, this actually causes a loss in performance, as the upper stage now has a poorer mass fraction than it could have.
payload: 10t to LEO, expendable




**VBB - 3 engine Launch Vehicle.**
__________________
Ok, the fun one, 2 stages, 3 first stage engines, this makes a much more typical looking LV.
Maximum mass of this vehicle should be about 638t, so this masses a bit more than the Falcon 9.


For this, lets use the spec of the 95t mass 2nd stage i calculated first earlier



**Now the 1st stage.**

max 1st stage mass  = 536t

58.3t dry mass

prop mass 454t

TWR 1.15 - 4.3

g * 327.5 * log(638/(58.3+95.0+27)) + g * 450 * log((95+27)/(8.0+27)) = 9569 m/s

So our 3 engine rocket can send 27t to LEO in expendable mode.

Now i don't know the how much you would have to reduce the payload to to be reusable. you probably want to subtract the extremely rough 15% or 30% (RTLS) figures quoted for SpaceX, maybe a tiny bit more because of the lack of suicide burn.

BlueOrigin,"I just developed a crazy new theory on this: https://www.google.de/maps/place/Blue+Origin/@47.4086073,-122.2382102,57m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x54905be955555555:0x884890929e744733!6m1!1e1

(If you want to see the imagery of the 'base' you need to tilt the perspective of the google maps image.)

I think it might be a hub between different modules of a Blue Origin moon or marsbase. Why a hub? Because its the most efficient way of getting around between modules. Also, it has stairs that go all around.
If you extend the circles to the right via an imaginary line further out (I know all of this sounds like a conspiracy theory) you can see a small circle on about the height of New Shepard or a large one below the hub.
Its easy to imagine other modules and a New Shepard functioning as a module itself (modules could be landed as cargo).

I got the idea because the lines and circles look like the connecting rod of a car: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecting_rod#/media/File:Haupt_und_Nebenpleuel_BMW_132.jpg

finally, why would they build a mockup so far at the side of their property that they're gonna run out of space? Probably because they dont want anyone to know that they're building one, yet.

I'd very much like to know your ideas/possible timeframes and or different theories what BO might be up to!",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/42ca4r/new_theory_on_blue_origins_backyard_platform/
BlueOrigin,"So by now we've all heard about the successful re-use of the New Shephard booster (if any Blue Origin engineers are here, well done, you guys did great!)

My question is, what now? What're Blue Origins plans for 2016?
Specifically:

Now that re-usability of the New Shephard booster is confirmed, what needs to be done for the system to be man-rated and put on the market for suborbital toruism? And is that likely to happen this year, or is that wildly optimistic? As far as I know, there's been no manned test-flights of the system, although unlike Virgin Galactic New Shephards tests have actually done the flight profile it's supposed to do. 

Do we have any idea about the size of Blue Origins orbital rocket design? Are we likely to get more information about it this year?

Sorry if those questions are obvious, I'm only a casual follower of Blue Origin (their secrecy makes it difficult to really engage with them more than periodically, although what they're doing is still awesome) Thanks for your time! ",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/42aouz/blue_origins_plans_for_2016/

BlueOrigin,"Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket made history as the first rocket to do a vertical landing after a flight to suborbital space. It is intended only as a suborbital rocket.
However, by using triple cores of the New Shepard with a small upper stage, a la the Delta IV Heavy, you actually get an orbital rocket:

Triple Cored New Shepard as an orbital vehicle.

BlueOrigin,"I was trying to get an idea of how well the BE-3 compares to the RL-10, in particular any authoritative info about its Isp.  I figured hey, why not just ask?  So I submitted a note via their Contact Us form asking for details on the BE-3, specifically about its Isp.  I also took a shot and asked if they have a public date for the next New Shepard launch.

They sent me a nice note the next day and told me what a great, modern, low-cost engine it was.  They also pointed me to the Technology section of their website for info on BE-3 (which I, of course, had already looked at), and said they wouldn't release any information outside of what was posted there.  They also said they couldn't tell me anything about the next launch.

I sort of figured that's what would happen, but didn't hurt to try.  Even though I don't have new info to share, I figured I'd post about it, in case it had occurred to anyone else to try. They've opened up a lot as a company, but they still keep much close to the vest...

Hoping for another NS launch soon.  While they wait for the RTF it would be a small comfort to the SpaceX crowd to see *some* rocket RTLS, even if it wasn't Falcon.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/3mflpl/no_luck_getting_details_about_the_be3/

Since he hasn't declared any Mars or Planetary ambitions (and he kinda lost the development race to Spacex so far, even though BO has had a head start of two years). Bezos is not the guy to think small and might even consider stepping down as CEO of Amazon when BO takes off.
Just as Elon indicated that he might not always be CEO of Tesla.

What could Blue Origin possibly do of substance in space?

BlueOrigin,"I think it is very telling that Blue Origin currently has deals to sell the BE-4 engine to both ULA for the Vulcan, and to Boeing for the XS-1 reusable booster.

Since the Shuttle was designed, hardly any rocket engines have been designed in the US, and those that have (RS-68 for example) were evolutions of previous engines. It is as if the USA decided that after the SSME engine, there was no more point in developing chemical rocket engines.

And here we have this company who has never flown any payload even into a suborbital mission, but has decided to invest in modern rocket engine technology. Even with the engine years into the future, some very respectable companies seem to be jumping on it for their new products. That's just because there is no alternative! 

Aerojet Rocketdyne is planning the AR-1 engine, but they are years behind Blue Origin. And AR-1 would probably not be usable for XS-1 since it needs to be reusable.",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/3g3w33/blue_origins_success_shows_the_demise_of_rocket/

While I am not one to read to much into these types of things, I cannot help but wonder if lunar development is BO's long term ambition, similar to the way that Space X had their sight set on Mars at some point in the long term future. Of course I could see the prominent placement of the moon in this video as simply a choice to show something familiar and inspiring, more of a marketing tactic than anything else. It does make you wonder, however, what they plan to do beyond develop this suborbital vehicle and eventually their own orbital rocket. Space X is at the stage where they have orbital flight capability and thus is in a position to make it clear when they intend to achieve without being laughed at, do you think that some type of formal lunar proposals might come from them once they are doing the same?",/r/BlueOrigin/comments/34gxxd/noticed_that_in_the_animation_video_it_starts_and/
