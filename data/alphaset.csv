737 should have been abandoned right after NG or even at the classics, as it was obvious the design cannot be competitive in the future.

,"""under consideration"" means you haven't been eliminated.

After a req closes they screen out people who don't meet basic requirements. (Don't have degree, said you only have 2 years of experience for a senior positon, etc)

A manager will go through and look at resumes to pick people for interviews. Some managers will also use this time to mark off candidates they aren't interested in, but some don't.

Once they have picked interview candidates, tehy will schedule interviews and conduct them. If they pick a candidate, they will prepare an offer. Up until the selected candidate chooses to accept the offer, every candidate who hasn't been eliminated is ""under consideration."" There's no way to tell how many people are in pool with you

There is always the chance the selected candidate doesn't take offer or they decide to interview more people, so it can take awhile.

Sometimes the req is for multiple positions (a ""hub req"") in which case multiple managers are picking and choosing out of the pool. Sometimes a manager finds your resume and thinks you're a better fit for one of teh other managers hiring and will forward your note, so sometimes you get interviewed twice or hired by a manager who didn't actually interview you. Usually the req is clear its for several positions when its a hub req.

If you search deep within the archives of [airliners.net](https://airliners.net), you may find the plans and tooling for the 757 buried somewhere in there...

There have been some trade studies and chatter about a 767-MAX type aircraft, and when you look at it, it does make some sense on the surface. 7-wide seating with twin aisle, much lower weight than 787, and the GEnx-2b from the 747-8 has the right thrust and bleed air necessary for a 767 derivative. So this would likely be something like a 767-300 or -400 fuselage (220-270 pax, dead center of ‚ÄúMiddle of market‚Äù). New, advanced technology wings with GEnx-2b engines, advantages of twin aisle for longer 5000nm routes, and healthy demand for a freighter variant. On the other hand, this airframe likely has a commercial horizon of maybe 10-15 years. Pushing the envelope forward on newer architecture, build process, and materials may create a product with 35 year useful production run. In the current environment, dont expect any announcements of clean sheet aircraft any time soon.",/r/boeing/comments/htbifd/will_boeing_bring_back_the_757_in_place_of_797_nma/fygw37h/,172,1049

,"The 757 is interesting. It's design goes back to the 727.  The 727 was a very popular plane, but the airlines wanted it to carry more people and have a longer range.  Boeing tried to ""stretch"" it, but every redesign effort resulted in something that just didn't work.  So they designed the 757, a ""narrow body"" longer range plane.  It was a tremendous success. Yet, when they tried to ""stretch"" it into the 757-300, it was not successful enough to keep the production line profitable.  Just like there was no ""growth"" in the 727, there was not enough ""growth"" in the 757.

After that you could always go for your bachelor degree if you want to move to the office world. People in the office really value the experience that workers have on the factory floor. 
I have my A&amp;P before coming to Boeing but I started from Tooling and eventually make it to the flight line as an AMT after three years of trying. After the flight line I like the idea of being an ME so I apply for the technical ME in spare (BGS) actually got the position. When thing starts to get heat I have to move to a different position to avoid the lay off so I become an Integrated scheduling and planning specialists. Aviation is risky business so you just need to be flexible and stay competitive I guess. Boeing is so big and you could literally do anything except for high level IT. I think they have contractors to take care most of that. I would never be able to move around that easy without using my green lights training and utilizing the LTP to get my bachelors degree. 
If I was you I would go into the career explorer and look into some of the ERT green light and red lights process. Taking training over the weekend to turn your green lights on so you could do transfer to better and more exciting work. If you like the hand on training of Boeing then you should really start working on getting the A&amp;P licenses. The A&amp;P licenses are valuable in the aviation industry and it will open a lot of doors for you in the future.",/r/boeing/comments/hsbd3a/ltp_for_indemand_jobs/fyb93fj/,304,1639

So I'd say you may have to think a little about what you want in the future, but even if you have no idea, pick something which sounds appealing and go with it. It's free education!

As someone else pointed out, a cert is a good way to get in without commiting too much, as a degree program has a 2-yr requirement after you're done. Also check the tax requirements - if you do an individual course you will be taxed over $5k of the course(s) you take. That won't apply for a cert if it is related to your job though, the definition of which you can probably make very broad since Boeing is so big. But you'd have to check.

I went to school for journalism and never saw myself working for Boeing until it just happened. Now that my foot is in the door I'm just trying to figure out how I can learn about the industry and what opportunities are out there. I know that's really vague but that's my starting point haha.

,"First off, good on you for utilizing LTP! Many people are just trying to ride this situation out, but now is an important time to improve your career, and LTP is a great resource.

Honestly, this question is way too broad. Are you looking for specifically in the aviation industry? What about corporate supporting unit for aviation (i.e. IT)? What do you enjoy doing? There's no point getting a degree and a job in something you hate. 

Google the in-demand degrees right now - CS is always one. Data science is too, but don't fall for the growth/supply inequity that is prevalent in hot degrees. Data science is growing a lot, but it's still really small, and the growth of supply is outdoing it. Similar to bioengineering a few years back. Do note - would love for someone in the data science field to correct me on this if I'm wrong. 

Certs are a great place to start - they won't take as long, improve your career a little bit, aren't subject to 2-yr requirements, and will expose you to a new field.

,"From my experience, i graduated local community college with AS for Engineering degree.

Decided to get some certifications about aerospace assembly and machinist courses provided by few schools.

Got a job offer from minor company that paid bare minimum, stayed there for 3 years, and applied for job in Boeing, got interviewed 3 times in a row.

All I can say is, you need to look for what they want from these thousands applicants. If job is about assembly, its obvious they want someone somewhat experienced and have some knowledge about its environment. 

Most people I have talked to in Boeing all had some form of work experience! Even if it is not related with mechanical background, but it needs to have something related with its background, easiest one to gain is from certification course, which some courses only takes about 3-6months to complete. 

Make sure you make your resume right! They will literally spend 2 sec to look at your resume.(trust me, i am not even lying at all) Make it tight, short, clean, accurate!

They'll even go as far as helping you with your resume and interview training. That's what I did 6 years ago before I first started working for them, and I got hired almost immediately.

Other then that, Boeing does have a system in which your dad can go in and suggest you as an employee, like a referral program.

,"~~I‚Äôm going to guess that you are not a Boeing Everett worker.~~ Just read your comment history, looks like you‚Äôre not *currently* working there.

First of all, most of the planes being built right now at Everett are cargo planes. Passenger airlines are delaying or deferring orders, but the need for cargo planes has actually gone ***UP***. Passenger airlines actually fly tons of cargo, and with passenger flights down, cargo carriers need more capacity.

Also, just because it‚Äôs a really big building where manufacturing takes place doesn‚Äôt mean that it actually has a lot of manufacturing capability. There‚Äôs plenty of photos and videos online where you can get an idea of the the layout, but basically, there‚Äôs a lot of empty space that needs to be kept empty for moving around giant airplanes &amp; parts. There‚Äôs also a lot of heavy duty fixed machinery &amp; tooling that can‚Äôt be retooled to do anything else.

The larger and more complex a product is, the longer and slower the supply chain is, and the harder it is to change the product. 

There are definitely smaller shops and facilities Boeing has that could be re-purposed temporarily to make PPE or ventilators, but that‚Äôs not a cheap or easy thing to do, and wouldn‚Äôt make sense for Everett.

,"I've heard blue and spaceX have similar atmosphere to Boeing to an extent. But Boeing is one of the worst at it. Blue and space have a very tough mission so in sense they can't afford to waste time on politics. While Boeing always thinks it's superior and thinks it has time while Airbus is innovating left right and center. 

As far as HVAC goes it is absolutely boring as shit lol. Just product development was really fun. And I worked at a Japanese company. My department was brand new. I was like one of the first 50 employees to the department as an intern and their first direct hire intern and we supported the whole world's product development. But japanese have a good way to making teams feel like small companies so we were challenged to design, test, and support builds and even support customers. I was traveling once a month atleast and towards the end of my time to China mostly. In July 2017 I spent 3 days at home and that was only due to 4th of July and an Ed Sheeran concert and the rest of it was traveling. But because of the broad job statement I was always under the pressure to get everything done fast and right so I learned a lot and grew. Engineers my age at Boeing I found don't even come close to the experience and knowledge and the ""engineers intuition"" I've developed (probably why I was a level 3 at Boeing). But HVAC also has a lot of politics for the fact the products are really well developed that projects aren't as fast paced. My company was playing catch-up even though it's the world's largest company for HVAC it has no footprint in the US so it was trying to catch up. But japanese companies often time you'll find out if you're not japanese your career growth has a very hard glass ceiling that's breakable, but very hard to break.

Yeah I've already decided if/when I hop back into engineering, its going to be at a small company. I learned quickly here nothing kills my motivation and interest quicker than bureaucracy. PD and R&amp;D has always been the dream but its proving a lot harder to find than I ever thought. Though its hard to not at least glance at SpaceX and Blue's job postings. Boeing was my first real job in aerospace so I don't have a good measure how similar other aero companies are. I sort of figured any company in a field as highly regulated as aero is likely going to have lots of red tape.

,I start on Monday. I left Boeing this Monday and wanted to take a week break and just clear my head. The job sounds super technical. It's a new group and working on eletric hardware so a lot of thermal and structural correlation to deal with and having to meet defense and space standards is going to be tough.

,From my data gathering and speaking to countless mentors brt and pd is where most of the technical work is. But if you want very technical work HVAC is a good field for it. But not the product support side. Product development. Or turbo machinery product development is super challenging. That's what I started my career out in and the trade shows for them are full of so many technical specialists. Small companies is the way to go for technical. That's what I'm going with. With spaceX and Blue Origin or tech companies being an exception for me in the larger side since they keep you technically engaged.,/r/boeing/comments/hmmi6l/laidoff_boeing_workers_to_get_extra_federal_help/fxi29hs/,108,607

,I can totally get that to be honest. I think it is risky for sure. But I mean if you have the means to and want to take a break who's to stop you. If anyone asks during interview you just have to properly explain the gap. It's the same when I'm asked why I left job X and so on.

,"Hi! I have a question for Boeing employees currently working from home. My dad (who I don't live with, check post history for context as to my own life) is wrapping up his last year or two of work before he retires at Boeing in Everett. (He is 70 next year.) He's been home since February (he has medical reasons to be home) and he's very stressed, he signs online at 6am and often not able to sign off until 4pm. He's told me he's unable to check personal email until after 6pm and so can only reply once or twice a day; texts are rare, we haven't had a phone call since last year (literally, it has been all texts). He takes naps, sometimes 2-3 a day, when he's really depressed (that amount of sleep happened once many years ago at a previous job) and he's doing it again. Just sleeping the whole weekend. Doesn't speak much about work, kinda complains. A lot. He used to LOVE going to the office. Just adored his vanpool, loved his coworkers. 

Boeing employees - especially those of you with 10+ at the company and older - is this...normal? Is the demands of ""Changes"" happening that stressful? Is it really that hard to read your email and text family? Do you go 3-4 days unable to check your email?

Feel free to DM. I just don't understand what is happening that is causing him to push his family away like this. Thanks :)",/r/boeing/comments/hhz2g3/employeeemployment_question_thread_julyseptember/fx7cwfk/,250,1330

,"Being of the same backgrounds and, seeing stuff like this, I can't imagine why managers are surprised that more people are not speaking up as we have company-sponsored discussions on racism.

To be clear, what has been going on is abhorrent and absolutely must stop.  I sincerely hope that this session of civil unrest does that the waves in the 1960s, the Rodney King riots, the Freddie Gray riots, the Ferguson riots, and many other demonstrations did not.  Fortunately, it looks like these are more widespread and are not so ridiculously thuggish (ref. looting in the LA riots post-Rodney King verdict) that they shut down more reasonable debate.  People seem to have finally understood how messed up things are and how much they need to change.

That said, the Overton window has shifted enormously on a variety of topics, and continues to move swiftly.  I am not in a financial position to lose my job, in a potentially very public way, over something that was 'reasonable' at the time it was said, and which is no longer considered ok at some arbitrary point in the future.  

I have been told for decades that my role, as a straight-and-of-southern-heritage-WASPy sort, was to be quiet and listen.

,"Professional and experienced pilots are saying that the MAX is an unsafe plane (see the links below). Plus, some Boeing employees said that they wouldn't put their family on the MAX...enough said for me. If the very people who built the plane don't trust, I will not either. 

The MBAs and lawyers on the BOD couldn't care less about our lives. I will not be the next victim of Boeing incompetence and greed. I watched all the congressional hearings and the senate committee hearing and what I've heard scared me even more: the FAA can't do it job properly by lack of resources and qualified staff. They can't oversee properly what crooked Boeing does.
Since Boeing employees think the FAA are ""a bunch of idiots watching TV"", I have no trust in the certification process. 

Lots of pilots were not able to recover the plane fro a dive in the simulator. One of them, Mentour pilot, who has a very popular youtube channel removed the video of the sim. session when he crashed the plane in the exact same conditions as the Ethiopian pilots. He was able to recover the plane...

Unchanged body from middle of 20th century, from 60's and too big, too powerful, modern engines which are not compatible with the old frame....
This is not a mobile phone camera which you can fix with software patch.
There is many scientific articles stating that MAX should be never created because of the laws of physics. If is just wrong.

That would explain why MAX is still grounded since 2019 and why Boeing is under legal and criminal investigations.
Looks like someone wanted to save a lot of money by shortening the development process of a new model and was rushing with the sales by the decision of not making a whole new plane, starting with the drawing board but using the main parts from the old era and just upgrading some of them...
Not to mention things like hidden new additional software nobody was aware off, low quality parts and sensors from around the world without proper manufacture quality control etc... (the list is long)

It's a totally illegal aircraft with regard to the basic definition of Catastrophic and Hazardous systems and system redundancy.

On my team with BCA, the engineers with FPGA and software experience are usually the compliance finders. This is still very different from being the ones to design and test at the lower level. Everyone else mostly supports from a systems aspect.",/r/boeing/comments/hgwhmz/returning_back_to_boeing_thoughts/fw6l5ro/,90,512
,There‚Äôs a ton of good FPGA work going on at Boeing El Segundo and a bit in Seattle too. And last time I checked they have openings for this position. TC at Microsoft would be way better than Boeing though. Doesn‚Äôt microsoft also have FPGA work going on for their cloud?,/r/boeing/comments/hgwhmz/returning_back_to_boeing_thoughts/fw6k65e/,51,269
,"It's a bit of both. The work culture here I don't find it fun, but being around airplanes is always fun, and that more than makes up for it. I'm not sure what's open right now for you since BCA is on a layoff frenzy. If you can find some software jobs in BDS I'd say sure. You're always at that risk when you're new though, if layoffs somehow affect your organization you're almost always the first one considered since you bring the least ""Boeing skills"". As far as software goes it's definitely a lot better to work on software that goes on airplanes than just servers.   


I'd say specifically look at Boeing Defense and Space if you want to come back here, otherwise, Blue Origin and the likes are looking for FPGA people. You may also want to try a company called MagniX they're an electric airplane company that's hiring a bunch of software people.   


Overall you are in a bit of  ""grass is greener"" mindset, but to be fair that's the same mindset that brought me here. Although I'm going to be laid off (and I'm accelerating my lay off since I got a new job already), I don't regret working here.

,"&gt; It's not like the process of making the plane is going to reduce and the process won't change.

I'm a desk jockey, and on the defense side to boot, so I'm a poor source for insight on factory work...but this bit I've quoted seems quite contrary to the whole shebang of what's going on.  I am under the impression that several of our commercial programs ARE reducing the scope of the processes in order to reduce production rate.

If you are somehow the SOLE person who does a task within the entire enterprise, then I suppose you have a point.  But I would hazard to guess that for any given job code and level, there would be several personnel within the company that are knowledgable of the work, such that a given task doesn't need to be outright eliminated.  Likely that they won't *stop* projects, per se; merely slide schedule milestones to the right in order to account for reduced labor hours per cycle.

In my realm of things, the one guy I work closely with who got an ILO has been told that he has until July 1st to wrap up the project we'd been working, and needs to have a transition plan in place for his work tasks by July 17th. Then as of August, there will be no more development of the tool or process that he was in charge of, and I and another fellow or two will be left to pick up the maintenance of what the tool &amp; process are as of this summer, probably a handful of hours worth of activity for each of us to fit into our WIP each week, while (i'm spitballing here) some 20-hours worth of his work efforts will just cease as of his departure.",/r/boeing/comments/hcdxgl/manager_filing_for_extensions_for_certain_people/fviw63y/,298,1574

For transparency's sake, I will say I did get ILOd so there may be a bit of saltiness from that in the way I go about explaining or questioning. I did get a job already so ILO doesn't matter at this point.    
However, say for example the mechanics getting laid off, how does that work? It's not like the process of making the plane is going to reduce and the process won't change. Now for me personally I'm a DE in the FSCC program. My project is one of the top for the airplane program, my FSCC team is being cut by 50%, but none of our projects are being stopped. So why did we have to lose so many people if our work is considered this important? Given we are contracted to only work 40 hours a week, giving each head twice the amount of work somehow doesn't add up to me.

,"&gt;it's obvious that the flaws with this plane are greater than just MCAS because that would have been fixed by now.

The fix has taken so long because runaway stabilizer was recategorized as catastrophic by the FAA. This means anything (not just MCAS) that can cause runaway stab needs to have a less than 1 in 1 billion chance of happening. You may have heard about the wiring issues several months ago, which is related to the above. As far as the Seattle Times and Leeham says, the changes addressing MCAS specifically are the same as they were proposed 1 year ago.

Basically they needed to make major changes to the flight control system of the 737 to account for this recategorization. Oddly enough, non-MAX 737's will continue flying around with the old system, where runaway stab has never killed or injured anyone over 52 years. FAA was probably trying to send a message here with the recategorization due to the hit on their rep from the crashes.",/r/boeing/comments/hcqn3q/boeing_whistleblower_alleges_systemic_problems/fvhoykn/,168,958

Software Engineers are represented by SPEEA, as such all of our salaries are a matter of public record.  The chart that I linked shows the salary breakdown by number of years at Boeing and your engineering level.

I came in right out of college (with military experience in the past) at $82,000 a year.  After my first year my salary was adjusted by 3.3% bringing my salary to $84,706 a year.  That salary adjustment is something that happens every year in March and is based off a number of factors; including how other Software Engineers are paid across the sector, how well Boeing does, and how well I do in my personal accomplishments (merit.)

No one that is training us knows what‚Äôs going on and they‚Äôre moving people from BCA harnesses to the other areas.

I‚Äôm a bit concerned. While I certainly understand everyone has to pay their dues but how do I bring up that I am open to other positions within the company? As it stands as our managers option is to either A put us in one of two wire harness areas or B put us in warehouse.

,"&gt;What's sad is that Boeing could have launched a clean sheet design

This proves you have no real understanding of the issue. **Boeing going with a clean sheet design would be Airbus' wildest wet dream, far greater than even the MAX crashes.** It was the start of a replacement cycle for every airline and every major 737 operator was seriously threatening to go to the Neo if they didn't get a MAX ASAP, especially after American actually pulled the trigger. Given that delivery time is the factor here, let's do a quick analysis of the situation:

Let's make the very conservative estimate that the NSA(737 replacement) would enter service 2 years after the MAX did (in reality this would probably be 4 or 5 more years). Assuming that Airbus would maintain the 60 plane/month rate on the Neo, that is 1200 Neo's that would be produced before the first MAX was delivered. 

In the best case scenario, 1200 orders on the MAX backlog go to Airbus. That is **73 billion USD** in revenue (1200*121.8 *10^6 MAX 8 price* 0.5 customary discount) that Boeing loses to a competitor. For reference, the MAX debacle will cost Boeing around 25 billion USD and the Max development program cost around 3 billion USD.


That's a lot of cash lost, right? But realize this is the **best case scenario.** One of the primary drivers for building the MAX was that exclusively 737 airlines like Southwest and Ryanair, who happen to be some of the biggest customers, were on the brink of adding A320's. This would have been utterly devastating, as airlines are incentivized to stick with one type or manufacturer due to significant training and maintenance costs. Once another plane is added, this cost is eaten and there is far less incentive to stick with a single manufacturer. Losing your exclusive customers and the associated market share could cost untold billions in future sales on top of the 73 billion already lost. And let's remember, this is losing market share in by far the largest segment of the airliner industry. No way in hell widebody sales can make up for that.


At this point, it should be abundantly clear that a new plane was financial suicide. That too is the case from a performance perspective. It is almost certain that the 737 replacement would need to consist of majority composite materials in order to be competitive as the workhorse of Boeing for the next 30 years. No manufacturer in the world, including Boeing and Airbus, can currently produce composite aircraft fast enough to match (non-coronavirus impacted) demand in the narrowbody sector. And this is already 7 years after the Neo and MAX programs launched. Had Boeing gone ahead with the NSA, they would have likely rushed out some half-baked composite plane that wouldn't be particularly efficient or manufacturable. **Airbus then just sits there with 70% or greater market share in the largest segment of the airliner industry and shovels all that extra time and money into the A320 replacement, which comes out 10 years later and wipes the floor with the NSA.** Boeing then dies after losing most of the airliner market to Airbus.

In case this isn't abundantly clear by now: **No, a clean sheet design was not an option for Boeing. The MAX was inevitable.** How MCAS was designed is another issue and another essay, but the decision to launch the MAX was certainly justified.

&gt;The A220 will out sell the MAX before it's over.

&gt;Mr. Pierson, who is scheduled to testify at a House Transportation Committee hearing on the two 737 Max crashes, called on Boeing to shut down the Max production line last year. But the company kept producing planes and did not make major changes in response to his complaints....Executives were pressuring workers to complete planes despite staff shortages and a chaotic factory floor.... Mr. Pierson retired in August 2018, partly because he was uncomfortable with the conditions in the 737 factory.




management chose not to include certain features in the planes and run the way the company the way it is being run - if anyone is to blame for the greater part of all this it would be them to which I would agree with. do you think its reasonable and not in anyway disrespectful and condescending  to the 10s of thousands of employees who did their job honetly to the highest standard, who had no part in choosing to include those extra safety fetaures (or whatever they were) on the plane and voiced their displeasure off the way things are run?

,"&gt;So according to you, Board members should not understand the issues and what is at stake when they make a decision and sign off on projects? Proper oversight starts by a deep understanding of the products.

Nope, that is not what I wrote.  The RAA of board members in a publicly traded company is primarily fiduciary in nature. When you speak of signing off on projects and design decisions, you are thinking of a Chief Technology Officer.  The senior chief engineers in Boeing and VPs of engineering that report to the CTOs contribute to and execute most of the technical vision.

A board is required by incorporation law that roughly states ""a board of at least three members shall manage the company""... so by definition they are more managers than anything else. Many times members of boards are on multiple company and non profit boards.  It is worth scrutinizing the role of boards in america and why companies pay these figureheads exorbitant amounts .... or why a politician like Nikki Haley could be allowed on Boeing's Board - and how it relates to favorable business deals Boeing got in her state.  

It is not reasonable to expect the board of any company to have technical skills related to the manufacture of their product. You're looking at the wrong level. Arguably some of the worst executives have been engineers.  If you think poorly of Muillenburg's leadership of Boeing, remember that he was an engineer first and an engineer at heart. There are hundreds of Boeing products and DM couldn't possibly know them all. The CEO of BCA was a little closer to the problem. That would be Kevin McAllister, who was also an engineer and while he was fired because this happened under his supervision, the design started long before he was at the helm.  That would be Ray Conner as CEO of BCA before McAllister.  He started as a mechanic, so he probably knew a little about planes.  

You know what I think the original sin is here? Money.  But not in the way you think.  Have you seen how little the safety engineers at the FAA get paid? The FAA can't afford great engineers or enough engineers to provide oversight.  You said: ""Proper oversight starts by a deep understanding of the products."" I agree with that in the context of proper technical oversight.  Government engineers are paid enough to attract talent and there aren't enough of them to provide proper oversight.",/r/boeing/comments/h02v2r/do_any_of_you_feel_guilty/ftm1k8b/,412,2389

,"Global scrutiny and that accountability to congress are a plus. EASA isn't just going to take FAA's word on anything to do with the 737, which is a plus for consumers.

You have a right to chose not to fly on a boeing commercial aircraft.  Exercise it all you want when shopping for tickets.  But airlines are going to buy whatever is cheapest (purchase + operating cost) to fly a route.  What plane flies a route is subject to change at anytime due to delays or maintenance.  So be vigilant because the 737 MAX will be flying a lot of routes and soon.  

I don't need a board member to be able to write a line of MISRA, work on a matlab model, or even be able to read a diagram. Thats not their job.  What do you think a board member does?

Wiring issues, good thats closer to evidence based thinking. There are miles of very important wires in a plane. What exactly is wrong with the wires? If a plane is found to have burs or debris from the manufacturing process where they might rub on a wire, then it gets fixed, other planes get inspected to see if they are affected too, and the process that lead to that problem gets re-assessed to prevent it in the future.  S.O.P.

Now maybe you are referring to the hot wire short theoretical issue. Story is that the 737 has a power wire too close (it is against FAA standards) to the control wires for the horizontal tail. FAA says its against the rules.  Boeing says it hasn't ever been a problem. They consider it low risk because there would have to be a fault first and then the distance comes into play and there is still okay, but not up to spec, separation. In my humble opinion the FAA needs to sack up and tell Boeing to eat the cost and move the wires.  Then the FAA needs to inspect the shit out of it, because that sort of retroactive change can actually introduce all sorts of room for errors and failure (see the burrs up above).  

Boeing found and reported the wiring separation issue as part of a re evaluation safety.  They aren't hiding it.  They are just asking FAA if they really have to make the change.",/r/boeing/comments/h02v2r/do_any_of_you_feel_guilty/ftliiec/,390,2072

,"I am unsure how they actually monitor.  My *guess* is that someone reported it somewhere (there's a hyperlink at the bottom of insite to report posts as inappropriate), but I suppose I would not be surprised if they've tasked someone with passively monitoring all posts in such a group.

I was called by someone from the ""End User Computing"" group 4 business days after the post, who said that he'd gotten a report of concerns over a post on the Insite Group Boeing Dank Memes.  He then pulled it up, and gave me a bit of a ""I get the dark humor, but there are concerns about the gun violence"" chat.  He offered to help me edit it, but I asked if he could just remove it altogether, as I wasn't concerned with sharing the opinion, merely going for a laugh. It was removed that day.

8 business days after the post, my manager informed me that he'd been notified of a security threat investigation naming me as a security concern.  

On the 10th business day, a corporate investigator interviewed me and had me virtually sign a statement acknowledging the facts of the content within the post, and attesting that I meant no threat of any kind, and that the post was made in ill conceived humor.  My boss said there were fair odds I'd get a CAM, and it usually comes with a day's suspension.

On the 14th business day, I was served the CAM with a 5-day unpaid suspension.  The CAM itself was fairly vaguely worded, just stating that I'd made a post on an internal Boeing site that contained inappropriate violent content, and then had the Boeing Behaviors descriptions regarding employee performance written out.  I took the suspension for the duration of the following pay period.

I do also regret that I didn't check out the viewership stats before the post was removed.  My assumption that someone reported it is based on it having had something 60some bumps when I got the call, which indicates a fair number of folk viewed it, and the fact that it took a few days for it to be flagged.  If only a dozen or so folk had bothered to look at it, or it was flagged within a day, I might be inclined to think that they're having IT monitor all posts.",/r/boeing/comments/gxgm1l/ee_on_insite_is_entertaining_in_the_worst_way/ftefxzk/,392,2148

‚Ä¢ Are eligible to receive a continuation of medical insurance for up to six months after date of layoff, and

‚Ä¢ Will forfeit recall rights and lose seniority (the same as those accepting the lump sum payment option on regular layoff benefits or those who retire from Boeing). Therefore, anyone requesting the voluntary layoff should be certain they will not return to Boeing in the future.

‚Ä¢ If more individuals apply for voluntary layoff than the allocated reductions, requests will be approved based on employees with the highest seniority.

‚Ä¢ Those approved will be coded as being laid off, for the purposes of reporting to the state Employment Security Department. However, there are specific rules that may limit unemployment insurance benefits for those laid off, who then receive retirement benefits.

,"I got contacted by a recruiter for Lockheed Martin the very same day that Dave Calhoun announced that ILOs were going to happen at the end of April. It was pretty serendipitous. I was in a pretty bad mental state after that day at work so I figured what the hell, I'll apply. Let's see what happens. Well, 8 days later I had a job offer. 

I would have had to move across country and taken a slight pay cut. But I told my manager that I had a job offer that I was considering taking, but I would much prefer to stay at Boeing and I asked if there was anything he could say that I could count on to help me make the decision to stay. 

He told me that  he would be genuinely surprised if my skill code got hit much worse than it already was, although it wasnt in his direct control, obviously. The amount that got WARNs last week was already really high and we're bordering on a staffing level that is pretty close to crippling productivity and we likely cant afford to lose much more without falling behind on a ridiculous amount of work. He said there was a decent buffer of people between me and the bottom of the rankings after the ILOs and VLOs take effect since they didnt cut all the R3s. He basically said that based on his awareness of the situation, I should be okay this time around. 

It was a 50/50 decision between accepting the offer or staying at Boeing, but I decided that I would roll the dice and stay here. I wouldn't have felt good about either decision.

,"I haven't seen what you've seen as far as the schedule goes, but it would make sense that people would be leaving for a good chunk of the rest of the year. People who got notice last week will be leaving late July. People who get notice at the end of this month will leave end of August... and so on. 

The director of structures engineering sent out an email a few weeks ago saying there would likely be a handful more layoffs in Q3 this year for BCA engineering, but it was unknown if it would affect structures engineer job codes specifically. If they get WARNs in Q3 then they would be leaving at the end of the year. 

I talked to my manager yesterday and he said that engineering already has gotten hit really hard (~18% company wide) and that if they cut much more that work wouldn't get done. Not sure if upper management knows that... 

He didnt give me any official promises, but he said that where I stand in the retention rankings that he didnt expect I'd get hit relative to the additional layoffs that my skill code could reasonably endure without completely crippling productivity.

,"I have recently (from late Feb to now) applied for a few jobs on the Defense side at Boeing. For the first two I was already informed that I was not selected to move forward, but for the third one I received an email the next day with this in the body:

&gt; Thank you for your time in completing this process. Please click here to login to Careers at Boeing to complete the Conflict of Interest questionnaire. The questionnaire must be completed in order for your application to move forward to the next steps.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Please connect with your Talent Acquisition Advisor with any questions. 

I never got anything like this with the other jobs I applied for. Does this mean that this application is moving forward, at least more than the other two? Or could it be that the other two just did not require the questionnaire to be filled out? And with that last sentence saying to connect with my Talent Acquisition Advisor with any questions, I have not be assigned or contacted by any Talent Acquisition Advisor, is that just a blanket statement, or should I know who that is?

&amp;#x200B;

Another question regarding this job. The posting for the job was already taken down, less than a week after it was initially posted, but my profile on Workday says I am still under consideration. Does this mean that they already received enough applicants that they feel like moving forward with or is the job just not there anymore?

Obviously due to ESGR they have to maintain your job or similar but in my experience Boeing has gone beyond the requirements which makes sense given their military contracts.

,"Not long winded at all, I really appreciate the information. I have a lot to think about on this one. It seems like, overall, it would be beneficial to wait, have 6 years experience w/ a Masters to get on as a Level 3 vs getting and and fighting for an early level 3. 

It's the same thing at my company. You can get hired on as a senior engineer(seems like y'all's level 4 equivalent) if you have 8 years of Eng experience (or 6w/PE). However, it's tough to move up internally through the engineering progressions I.e. rather than reward you for meeting expectations you get it held as a carrot in front of you - ultimately getting promoted later than an external hire would come in as with the same years experience.",/r/boeing/comments/fzylh9/employment_related_question_thread_aprjun_2020/fs82eri/,133,718

,"Possibly, especially if that's yet another year of work experience under your belt.  I would say that having it before you're hired and as early in your career as possible is how to get the biggest payoff.  For example, I know of a few young guys that had no experience but got hired as lvl 2 engineers bc they had their masters.  Meanwhile, a new hire without a masters might work for 3 or 4 years before going to lvl 2.  Even later, as like a lvl 4, you could get your masters and basically no one even knows or cares.

I started to get mine and it's all initiated on your own.  You don't need managers approval etc.  So while I was doing my first coarse I had one Thursday or something when I left work early to finish some work that had to be uploaded by 5pm iirc.  Anyways the next day I basically got chewed out a little when I mentioned to my manager that the reason I left early was for school. It wasn't that bad but basically he didn't care at all if I got my masters and said something to the tune of it won't help me do my job any better (which is pretty true).  I stopped doing it when I was talking to another guy who had just graduated and said that literally nothing happens when you graduate... it's not like they call you into a room to tell you you're getting a raise.  I do suppose that once you have it it could help boost you to a lvl 3 slightly faster.  Hopefully some others can chime in and verify.  Like I said above, I didn't finish.  

Sorry that's long winded.  There is one advantage though to getting a masters while at boeing: they will pay for it.  Also, in general I certainly wouldn't encourage you to not get a masters.  I wish I had finished bc it helps pad your resume and gives me more opportunities if/when I'm looking for a new job.",/r/boeing/comments/fzylh9/employment_related_question_thread_aprjun_2020/fs7zhdr/,343,1773

does anyone have any knowledge about the assistance programs and/or severance packages? when i was getting hired on friends i made would always say things like ""and worst case scenario you get laid off, get put on a callback list, and they'll pay for your school while you wait"" but checking the IAM751 website it looks like their only approved vendors are highly specialized (useless) vocational programs or whatever (cosmetology/truck driving/resume training)  


I was hoping to start a career path towards electrical engineering or robotics or something -not truck driving.

,"I'll bite since you're clearly trying to antagonize people going through a rough time. What sources and evidence do you have to backup your claim? 

Every regulatory body has their eyes on the MAX and Boeing has gone through the engineering with a fine tooth comb to fix anything that might remotely cause a problem. This will no doubt be the safest airplane to ever fly. To think otherwise would be pretty ignorant since the company's future is staked in a successful return to service of the MAX. Boeing has self-reported additional findings that they have committed to fix. 

Furthermore, not absolving the Boeing of any design mistakes made, but the airlines are also at least equally to blame. Poor maintenance and pilot training standards played a major role in the crashes.  If you're interested in educating yourself read the article below. The MAX crashes are not a simple black and white blame game. It is pretty complex and nuanced situation that can't be summed up in the headlines.

,"The 737 definitely should not have had the life it has. It is a thoroughly outdated plane that was designed as a cheap regional jet without even pylons, and Boeing is trying to make it a damn transatlantic airliner out of it.

My question is: Why didn't Boeing just kill it in the 90s after the merger with McDonnell Douglas? McD was already making the MD-80 &amp; MD-90, developed from the DC-9, which, unlike the 737, was built from the ground up as a domestic airliner (which it was used as for its whole life). Boeing also had the 757, in all its glory, which was:

A. A much newer, more modern airliner, that was designed from the ground up to replace the 727

B. Not being used for routes beyond its potential (even the routes it's used on now are still well within the 757's capability)

Why not just kill the 737, and replace the -400 and -800 with a smaller 757 built to match the -400's capabilities, and then replace the -500, -300, and -700 with the 717 and an MD-80/90 with 717-style upgrades? The MD-80s were hardy planes that would have a long life. The 737's production numbers now are YUGE, but at the time of the merger, the edge it had was nowhere near as massive (2975 units of the plane were sold by 97, compared to the 2283 DC-9/MD-80/MD-90s sold). Why not just make 2 product lines for two different things instead of clumsily trying to develop one plane into all the roles? Boeing clearly wasn't averse to it, as they put the 717 into production, which would have DESTROYED the 737-600. Most of the work was already done.",/r/boeing/comments/hrzk1a/why_didnt_boeing_discontinue_the_737_after_the/,284,1545

,"In light of of 747 production ending, I was wondering how much longer we can realistically expect to be able to take a flight on one. Since the coronavirus outbreak began and people stopped flying most airlines have little use for huge aircraft anymore. Many -400 operators who were planning to fly for a few more years have now retired their 747s early. Many -400 frames are pushing 30 years old now and sadly they probably won‚Äôt be flying passengers anymore very soon. The A380 isn‚Äôt doing much better and has also been grounded or retired by several airlines.

Since there aren‚Äôt that many -8i models in service to begin with it‚Äôs not that unlikely they would be next to go. Even if air travel demand picks up again soon it will be gradual, and a much more efficient 777 or A350 will probably be big enough to meet the needs of most airlines for several more years.
The few airlines that fly the 747-8i could all probably use some extra cash right now more than some huge aircraft they can‚Äôt fill.

Despite passengers not flying, there is still huge air cargo demand. Due to this I think the 747 is less doomed in general than the A380 which has no freighter version. All the -8i frames are relatively new and would probably be worth a lot as cargo haulers, so I suspect many will soon be converted to -8f models. Honestly I hope this doesn‚Äôt come true any time soon, but the way the world is right now it‚Äôs not looking hopeful.",/r/boeing/comments/hqyedn/will_the_7478i_survive_the_pandemic/,263,1431

,"Hi all,

I was an intern back in 2019 in flight controls in the midst of the whole 737 MAX fiasco. I really enjoyed being able to surround myself with airplanes, going to the labs, playing around with the flight simulators, etc. I never received a return offer (guessing because of the 737 MAX incident) so I started applying for jobs elsewhere and have been working as a software engineer at Microsoft since March (I studied EE with a minor in CS). The money is really good but I don‚Äôt feel fulfilled working on Azure/cloud technologies. 

I also remember that I didn‚Äôt particularly enjoy the work at Boeing as an intern (maybe it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt have much) but loved the environment of being around airplanes. I wanted to do something cool like write code or do FPGA work on the avionics systems, and would ask my manager which team does that, but he basically said that you gotta go to Rockwell Collins and that we do more systems level work which sounded less interesting to me. I wouldn‚Äôt mind returning as an FPGA engineer or an electrical engineer, though my focus was more on FPGA/embedded systems in college, which is why I was easily able to apply for software roles as well. I don‚Äôt care about money I just want to love what I do everyday. Am I in a case of the grass is always greener? Or should I try applying back to Boeing. Thoughts?

,"Hello,

I know this is really specific question but since it is ""your"" aircraft I hope that someone here undestands that well. In fact this happened to me few months ago and there was quite a huge discusion about that in company because none could really explain that.

You have 747 and you prepare it for long flight. About 140 tons of fuel. That means wings full and about 30 tons in CWT. But the fuel scavenge system is INOP. Does not matter if electric or hydromechanical, but let's say it is electric. It is MEL **28-15-01B Center Tank Fuel Use Limitation** 

&gt; May be inoperative provided:   
&gt;  
&gt;a. Fuel scavenge pump is deactivated.   
&gt;  
&gt;b. Center tank fuel is considered payload fuel.   
&gt;  
&gt;c. Maximum allowable zero fuel weight is reduced by the first 1360 kg of center tank fuel.   
&gt;  
&gt;d. The first 1360 kg of center tank fuel is considered unusable.

Points a, c, d are clear to me. I understand that there will be 1360 kg of fuel stuck in CWT and I won't be able to use it.

But can someone explain me point b? I though I have to reduce allowable payload on the flight by amount of fuel in CWT.( It reminded me jettison pumps problems on B777 when the fuel can get stuck in center tank which means that they would not be able to get rid of that and would be landing with ""empty wings and heavy center tank and wings would not be happy."") But it makes no sense for scavenge system. And it was confirmed by our engineering department that the only limitation is that 1360 kg and not whole CWT. But it took them while to find out and said they ""do believe"" the ""payload fuel"" is supposed to mean usable fuel. Which would make all clear but I have never seen ""payload fuel"" in any other manual that DDG for 747. Nothing in B777 or B787. I do not have any other ""huge Boeings"".

And same ""payload fuel"" term is used in MEL regarding jettison pumps. And yes, I could guess they mean it is usable fuel but it seems to be very tricky.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR. What does Boeing mean by ""payload fuel"" in  B747 DDG?",/r/boeing/comments/h9nato/could_you_help_me_understand_boeing_fuel_system/,379,2049

,"Boeing has provided a lot of things to help keep people safe during this pandemic. Masks, gloves, hand sanitizer everywhere, hand washing stations, temperature screenings, etc. Utilized properly, these resources would probably be pretty effective.

Unfortunately, many of the people who work in the factory are idiots.


Some of the things I am witnessing:
-	People removing their masks to speak to each other from one to two feet away. Like it is obstructing their ability to be heard.
-	So many people leaving their nose uncovered for comfort.
-	I‚Äôve heard people mock others for being careful or concerned.
-	The 6 foot rule is rarely followed outside of standup meetings.
-	Still seeing people leave the restroom without washing their hands.
-	On the way in and out of the factory, there are still a hoard of people shoulder to shoulder.
-	Many people show up without a mask on and remove the mask as soon as they walk out the door, while in the middle of the hoard.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm forgetting other things but this is enough to illustrate the point I want to make. Wearing cheap fabric masks is not going to prevent anyone from getting sick if we have to rely on the personal accountability of morons.

,"Update COVID-19 ‚Äì March 20, 2020
Our Union is continuously working on your behalf and is very concerned about the current situation. ¬†
¬†
1) You have the right to take time off work.
So far your union leadership has secured that members who are high risk, or who need to care for children that are out of school, or are ‚Äúconcerned with working on site due to Coronavirus,‚Äù can take time off from work, and use excused LWOP, without having to exhaust benefits or face discipline. Be sure that you follow your organization‚Äôs requirements for reporting daily absences.
Anyone placed on mandatory quarantine and sent home due to COVID-19 or potential exposure to COVID-19 will be paid for up to 14 days. (The Company has defined mandatory quarantine as direction from Boeing Health Services and/or a public health official to quarantine because of a risk of COVID-19).
Anyone sent home by management due to being generally ill or has received direction from Health Services or a medical professional to remain out of work due to a general illness or non-COVID related illness will be able to use their benefits or excused LWOP to cover these absences.
We had reports that some managers were denying requests for excused LWOP. We asked Boeing to immediately educate their managers to correct this issue. We will continue to enforce these provisions. If you have an issue and need assistance, please contact your Steward and Business Rep.¬†
[NOTE: For an absence lasting more than 7 consecutive calendar days (other than vacation), contact the Boeing Leave Service Center at¬†866-473-2016¬†to request a leave of absence. When the system asks ‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù say ‚ÄúLeave Service Center‚Äù and have your WorkLife password available. If you are on excused LWOP to care for children that are out of school or are concerned with working on site due to Coronavirus, this will be a nonmedical or personal LOA, which provides three months of continued active medical coverage at the active employee rates.]
¬†
2) You have the right to continue to earn a living.
¬†
Excused LWOP provides options for some, but there are members that must have their paycheck. The union leadership has received calls from members that are frustrated we have not called for Boeing to shut down operations in Puget Sound. This union membership includes 32,000 families that depend on their paychecks to survive. If we demand that operations be shut down, we have no way of knowing how long a shutdown will last and how much pay members will receive.
If our factories are shut down, either by the state or the company, we will demand to bargain the effects of this change in working conditions to capture as many resources as we can for our members.
3) You have the right to a safe workplace.
In the meantime, it is incumbent upon all of us to hold Boeing to their own safety practices and enforce them on the shop floor. In areas where this is not happening, we need your help. Members should use the ‚ÄúImminent Danger‚Äù clause to enact the contractual process designed to ensure members are safe in the workplace before work continues.
CONTRACT LANGUAGE READS:
16.1(c) Should the employee believe that there is imminent danger due to work required to be performed, the employee should inform the immediate supervisor and/or the responsible site safety manager or a designee. In addition, the employee may contact the Union Steward or a Health and Safety Institute (HSI) Site Safety Committee member who will assist in contacting the Site Safety Manager.
16.1(d) Work will not continue until the responsible Site Safety Manager or designee makes the final determination concerning the safety of the individual and the work to be performed.
¬†
Click here for the list of Site Safety Committee members.
¬†
4) Workers Should be Protected in Any Federal Bailout
Our Union is also working hard on the legislative front, at both the state and federal level. We are working closely with legislators to ensure that any aerospace industry bailout at the federal level includes protections for aerospace workers at Boeing and throughout the supply chain.¬†
We are also working with the Governor‚Äôs office and Employment Security Department officials to try and remove barriers to accessing unemployment insurance benefits for those workers who are at high risk of severe health consequences from COVID-19 infections due to their age or underlying medical conditions.

As I'm not an engineer, I was wondering if that's actually what the article is discussing, and if that's the case would that make the new 777x the first Boeing airliner to use fibre optics instead of metal wires in its system (the article makes it seem the 777 used the same system, but I've never heard of anyone referring to it as anything other than FBW)?",/r/boeing/comments/f5p4j9/are_any_of_boeings_commercial_planes_fly_by_optic/,100,652

,"Good morning,  


Currently I'm active duty military making \~60k a year (BAH, Base Pay, BAS, etc), and I'll be finished with my Bachelor's degree come August. I've got 8 years of service in, so I'm looking to separate come next February. I recently was extremely lucky to get offered a job at an intelligence subsidy of Boeing in Virginia, where cost of living is absolutely nightmarish. The pay code they've given me is VBK3/ Level P3, which I'm unsure of how this translates as far as promotion potential or such. The end result is me accepting this job has the pro of getting me into the intelligence field but the con is there's a real possibility I'll have to work 2 full time jobs to make finances work there.  


Any knowledge of the pay scales, moving up, etc. would be immensely helpful. I could probably supplement living costs for a year with savings and be ok, but if its a long wait time then I need to begin evaluating how far I'm willing to commute, etc. For reference the job I'm accepting is around Maryland/DC/Virginia capitol area",/r/boeing/comments/f4swti/accepted_an_offer_but_feasibility_seems/,187,1050

,"I know, any time reading that question you would answer ""pressure at that altitude wouldnt allow you to push the door outwards to open it"", but hear me out. As you may or may not know, Boeing 767's door opens to the inside. I mean it just lifts up  to the ceiling. so it would be easier for pressure to push it inwards, so it can be opened easily, right? Or pressure thing is not how it works? Or it could just open and create rapid de-compression? I would love to see your answers, had it in my curiosity when i saw a FA closing the door of 767 i was flying in, and it just came down from ceiling and sealed its own place.

He charged hours to my jobs, making it look like I wasn't doing my own work. Management eventually let me go because I couldn't get along with this guy.

,"Not trying to bait here, genuinely curious.

I was watching a video on how to visually tell the differences between Airbus and Boeing planes, and when they were comparing the 737 to the A320, they mentioned how the design of the landing gears  holds the A320 higher of the ground, while the 737 has much lower clearance.

This got me thinking... I know that the design of the 737 MAX was the result of trying to fit bigger engines on a plane with less clearance, which led to the repositioning of the engines and the change in balance of the plane, etc.

Is there a reason they didn't just decide to redesign the landing gear to give the plane more clearance instead? Would that have been a simpler design change?",/r/boeing/comments/eq2v5o/a320neo_vs_737_max_design_question/,130,713

,"Happy belated New Years!

So its been about half a year since /u/sigmatic_minor has joined the mod team. I feel the board has become pretty active and we see more people participating regularly. Our average activity has increased since then and there is a noticeable increase in sub count. So here are some list of changes we put in up to the end of 2019 to look back on:

*sigmatic_minor put in a lot of leg work on /u/Automoderator and quick message features for helping clean up clutter around the board.

*There was an early attempt to start a dedicated FAQ thread for the sites of various region but it fell apart pretty quick and the idea was scrapped.

*We began including an Employment/Newbie thread to consolidate frequently asked questions that includes application, benefit, and employee life questions into one thread. This is due to trend of similar questions being asked very regularly. Some classics include, ""Is it normal to not hear back after x months?"", ""Does LTP cover this?"", and ""What should I wear for first day?"".

*Due to excessive spam post, we placed a minimum karma requirement to begin a thread. Throwaway users with employment related questions are still able to post in the stickied thread.

*In case users have not noticed, a wiki is actually up now. It currently contains a broad answer to some frequently asked question. Will update more as we see more posts made by our contributors (you guys) that answers other questions.

I plan to try coming up with a census survey to gauge our demographic a bit better. Meanwhile, if you have some suggestion, the modmail and this thread is available (Some of you have messaged the modmail with some good inputs before).",/r/boeing/comments/ep9ry2/happy_2020_and_looking_back_on_last_year/,291,1694

," **A Time For Recusal: U.S. Judge Presiding Over Lion Air Cases Must Recuse Himself**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img aauy4vfrb9841...*

By: Anonymous

As the world watches, the United States‚Äô largest exporter Boeing reels in crisis, one arguably of its own making. Those in Indonesia watch too as Boeing‚Äôs misconduct first came to light at the expense of the lives of their countrymen.

In the wake of the deaths of 346 people, including the death of 189 Indonesians on board Lion Air JT610, we have learned that two men, two U.S. judges, preside over two of the most important cases in global aviation litigation history. We have learned that one of these men, Judge Thomas M. Durkin, is part of an illustrious heritage, one of the so-called ‚ÄúDurkin 5‚Äù or ‚ÄúDurkin Bunch‚Äù, hailing from a veritable brethren of accomplished American lawyers and politicians who grew up in one of the United States‚Äô quintessential American cities.\[1\] 

But whatever his pedigree may be, it is true in any country that the judge presiding over these cases should be free of bias, and even the appearance of bias would be enough for the judge to be recused. The need for the appearance of impartiality in the Boeing cases is even more important than ever as new reports surface of Boeing trying to influence airline executives to hold the party line and support Boeing‚Äôs story that the 737 max was not rushed to production and through certification.\[2\] Indonesians probably wince at the irony‚Äîthe *New York Times* and others have written of Indonesia as backwards and corrupt and lamented the state of aviation safety there. And here we are now learning each week of the backroom dealings of Boeing that first ultimately led to the pulverizing death of 189 Indonesians into the depths of the Java Ocean, and then the annihilation of 157 more souls from more than thirty five different countries left in small burned pieces in a crater in Bishoftu.

Thus, now more than ever, the Boeing 737 Max litigation serves a vital global purpose. It is a way that the U.S. sends a message to the rest of the world that it is not hypocritical, that the corruption it laments and seeks to uncover in the rest of the world is not tolerated in its own forums and its own halls of justice and governance. The world will rely on the United States legal system and the United States Congress to force Boeing to be accountable. Boeing‚Äôs conduct rushing the 737 Max to the air at breakneck speeds has shone light on safety issues impacting millions of lives, including those in their planes and those on the ground.

A key issue in the Lion Air matter is whether the presiding Judge Durkin will invoke the *forum non-conveniens* doctrine to dismiss the cases out of the United States‚Äîit is common knowledge, as Congress highlighted in its questioning of Boeing‚Äôs now terminated CEO, that Boeing is using the threat of this doctrine to force the Lion Air plaintiffs to settle for lower amounts.\[3\] Families outside the U.S. are acutely aware of this doctrine as they have seen it drive other Boeing lawsuits out of the U.S. and sharply limit if not eliminate the chance for non-Europeans and non-Americans to receive fair compensation after the horrific loss of life in air disasters. We know that if Boeing files a *forum non-conveniens* motion, Judge Durkin rules on it by himself.

Our research tells us that U.S. federal law provides that ‚ÄúAny justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned‚Ä¶ He shall also disqualify himself‚Ä¶ where he has personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.‚Äù\[4\] To see that Judge Durkin should immediately recuse himself, it is not necessary to question his honor or integrity. His impartiality might reasonably be questioned by simply looking at the numerous connections he has to Boeing and or its U.S. counsel, some connections dating back over the course of his career and some as recent as September of 2019:

\-Boeing‚Äôs lead trial counsel is a renowned U.S. trial attorney Dan Webb. Mr. Webb was Judge Durkin‚Äôs boss, and as recently as October 17, 2019, Judge Durkin acknowledged his longstanding relationship with Webb and even stated that he meets Durkin regularly at some kind of US Attorney gathering.\[5\] Boeing‚Äôs counsel thus has unique insight into how the judge‚Äôs mind works, having known him and supervised him during formative years of his career.

\-Judge Durkin‚Äôs former firm was a global firm called Mayer Brown LLP where he was a partner from 1993 to 2013. It is well known that Mayer Brown advised Boeing at least from 2010 through 2013 through a policy advisor who was sitting on and continues to sit on Boeing‚Äôs Board of Directors.

\-Judge Durkin‚Äôs brother James Brian Durkin is a leader in the Illinois House of Representatives. In 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, an organization called the  Boeing Political Action Committee appears to have donated significant money to Representative Durkin‚Äôs campaign.

\-Judge Durkin‚Äôs other brother Kevin P. Durkin is an aviation attorney at the Clifford Law Offices which represent numerous ET302 victims. As evidenced by Congress‚Äô questions of the now terminated Boeing CEO in October, the threat to dismiss Boeing lawsuits has focused on Lion Air cases. Indonesians have been told and now understand that If the Lion Air cases settle quickly, the value of the ET302 cases increases because those cases will remain as the sole U.S MAX victim litigation matter. Therefore, a ruling by Judge Durkin to dismiss Lion Air cases or statements by Judge Durkin which pressure Lion Air families to settle directly benefit the ET302 plaintiffs (and his brother) as it will increase or at the very least protect the value of the ET302 cases. 

When Judge Durkin summarized potential conflicts for the Lion Air Plaintiffs at the status conference in October of 2019, he only mentioned at a high level his connection to Dan Webb and loosely described his brother Kevin P. Durkin. He did not mention at all his own connection of Mayer Brown or Mayer Brown‚Äôs connection to Boeing during the time when Judge Durkin was there, and he did not mention at all his other brother‚Äôs receipt of Boeing PAC money. He did not mention how close-knit the Durkin family is (as has been reported and widely hailed as a cherished and almost folklore hallmark of the family). He also did not mention the well-recognized fact that the fate of the JT610 cases impact the ET302 cases and his brother‚Äôs fees‚Äîif the JT610 cases don‚Äôt settle quickly, the ET302 cases (and his brother‚Äôs fees) are put in jeopardy. 

Most troublingly, out of the blue, in a sudden and unexpected turn of events, in the same October 2019 conference where his longtime colleague Dan Webb appeared, Judge Durkin made statements indicating that in his view, the case law on *forum non-conveniens* would favor dismissing the Lion Air cases out of the United States:

***‚ÄúYou can't read these cases without coming away from it with the impression is the law is pretty -- pretty favorable to moving this case out and back to Indonesia.‚Äù***

He seemed to be warning the lawyers for Indonesian families that Boeing would be filing a ‚Äúserious‚Äù motion‚Äîand all of this *before Boeing has filed any motion*, and all of this in the wake of an unprecedented set of not one but two crashes where by the time Judge Durkin made his statements, it was well established that Boeing‚Äôs conduct on U.S. soil was the main cause of the death of all 346 people. 

People outside the U.S. are not scholars of the U.S. legal system, but even common sense dictates that Judge Durkin should do right by the Boeing cases and recuse himself. It is not necessary to question whether someone spoke to him, whether there was actual pressure placed on him directly or indirectly, through colleagues, family, or otherwise. The presence of actual improper communications or actual corruption does not matter. U.S. law requires that he recuse himself anyway. There are just too many connections for any well-meaning judge to remain impartial, consciously or subconsciously. At the very least, he should do what he did in one prior American litigation matter where he had potential conflicts less numerous or dramatic than those here, where he still offered to recuse himself if any party requested him to do so.\[6\] He has not made that offer to date.

Judge Durkin will preside over many important cases in his career, but equally important are the ones he should not preside over. We thank him for presiding so far over the cases concerning the loss of so many Indonesians, but we ask him to step aside now in the name of fairness and not give Boeing a chance to manipulate yet another outcome. Boeing must be held accountable for all loss of life in the United States, and the families of the men, women, and children who died on the 737 Max carrying Lion Air Flight JT610 deserve no less fairness than the citizens of the numerous countries affected by the 737 Max crash of ET302.

,"The PTO Transition fact sheet states the following: 

&gt; * New hires on or before June 21, 2019, begin accruing the remaining half of eligible vacation hours at the beginning of the 7th month of employment. On Dec. 20, 2019, their Vacation hours will convert to PTO and they will begin accruing PTO weekly.
&gt; 
&gt; * New hires after June 21, 2019, will have their vacation hours converted to PTO on December 20, 2019, and will begin accruing their PTO weekly at the beginning of their 7th month of employment.

I was hired after June 21, and my PTO balance in ETS shows 88 hours instead of the expected 40 (I still had all 40 hours of vacation left), which means my frontloading somehow became 11 days of PTO instead of just 5 days vacation. The new PTO calculator tool also shows me accruing PTO rate at 6 month date.

I am wondering if this was actually intentional, or if it will be clawed back. If it is correct, does that mean I have way more PTO then someone hired before June 21?",/r/boeing/comments/eimzp3/if_you_were_hired_in_2019_check_your_pto_balance/,184,991

,"To all my former compatriots at The Boeing Company, despite numerous issues challenging you this past year I just wanted to say my heart is with you all. You've had numerous failures and issues that I can only imagine bring many of you enormous amounts of stress.

That being said, before I left I noticed a great degree of abnormally poor desicions amongst upper management (mainly executive level). The bean counters and finance personnel adored short term gains over realistic results. In my opinion, this resulted in a catastrophic  realm of too many suppliers and contractors which easily broke down layers of communication. 

Another issue is Boeing is a giant institution and the fact that it is so broken apart into fractional subsectors is frightening. Large bureaucracy is not how you innovate anything but it is good at acquiring wealth in the hands of the few.

My only hope is that the execs realize this and look past greed to actually generate stability. Because they're obviously not on that path and competitors will eat you alive if it is not corrected.

God bless all of you, my heart is with you and I hope you correct your institutional issues.

,"Boeing will not build B737s for a while, with the [last of the NG Variant rolling out of the factory](https://simpleflying.com/last-boeing-737-ng-klm/) and [B737 MAX production halted as well](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-17/boeing-halts-737-max-production/11805552), Boeing won‚Äôt be building any 737s in 2020 (unless MAX gets back into production)

In 2014, Boeing said the B737 MAX was intended to be the replacement for the B737NG in 2020, but the MAX crisis has affected these plans a lot in 2018 and 2019 with two deadly crashes taking over 300 innocent lives. The last B737 NG is being rolled out of the factory ready to be delivered to KLM as PH-BCL, but the NG series won‚Äôt have a proper replacement for a indefinite while to come, with some reports saying that the [737MAX crisis is getting worse and worse will continue for years.](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/17/business/boeing-737-max-outlook/index.html)

Sad for 737 enthusiasts that both 737 variants are going to be cut (for now) and in January, Boeing‚Äôs 737 production lines will be completely empty. Boeing‚Äôs commercial production line will only consist of 747-8s, 777s and 787s.

,"Folks:

I used to work at Boeing (Boeing Computer Services in Bellevue, Washington back in the 1990's). I am now retired having completed a career from 2004 to 2016 at Intel in Hillsboro, Oregon.

Up until now, I had weird dreams of working at Intel, consisting of mostly realizing that I was running around Intel Oregon's hallways nude and trying to find my bedroom or clothing, but that was a post at r/intel which resolved to being insecure at work at Intel. Those happened years ago.

Up to now, I had absolutely no dreams of working at Boeing. This last week, however, the floodgates seemed to have opened up. And the flavor is very different.

No, I am not nude nor embarrassed. I am simply lost in a maze.

I am at my desk, but the office changes. I get up to go to the cafeteria, but instead of the cafeteria, I end up outdoors. The buildings face a desolate landscape of other buildings that are clearly abandoned. There is silence except for sounds of nature. No man made sounds.

I need to go back inside, but I forgot my badge so I knew that the electronic security doors would not work.

But, as I approach, the building I left, the building is different. The gate is closed, but the gap between the gate itself and the rest of the fence is so wide that not only could I squeeze through, I could piroulett through as if I am dancing in a ballet. 

When I got to the door of the building, the lock was open and dissassembled. I was able to push the latch back and open the door. No alarms go off, no on challenged me. In fact, there was no one in the building.

Machines are running. Computers are outputting tons of data. But there were no people. I walk to a manager's desk to try to look up on the computer where I am supposed to be. The computer keeps outputting peoples names but not my own.

Finally, someone walks up to me and says 'May I help you find you?' I explain to him that I am lost and I might be punished if I can't find my office.

He leads me outside, but dissapears when we had to walk through a puddle. He says that the pumps are broken and he must leave.

I end up at a bus station, but that mutates into a corridor of old dusty cubicles but no people. The lights start to dim. The hallway turns into a subway station, but there were no people, no one collecting money, and all of the locks were broken everywhere.

I see mom on the train, but it was going away.

I wake up.

Totally weird. Not threatening, not scary, not embarassing, unlike being naked at Intel.

What gives?

&gt; This led to Boeing building up deferred costs at a much faster pace and much higher than it had ever anticipated and teething problems after service entry did not make things better for the Dreamliner program.

I don't understand why RS-25 are used and not for example RS-68. They are two times cheaper, have similar atmosphere isp and are almost twice as powerful so only 2-3 would be required. They are currently used so there's no need to develop any new technology.

I was wondering if anyone is able to confirm if this part is original and was in the aircraft when it was built.

,"I was just offered a job at Boeing (Everett, on the 777 program) and am trying to decide whether or not to accept. Interested in any thoughts or input from people here. Some basic info:

My current job is decent, but I'm a contractor. I get:

1 week of PTO per year

1 week of sick time per year

10 paid holidays per yer

I pay almost $200/month for very basic, catastrophic-like health insurance (for just myself, no other family members)

I make a couple dollars more per hour than what I would be starting at with Boeing, but raises now are VERY, VERY rare, so my wage has been pretty much stagnant for the few years I've been here

One good thing about my current job is that they're pretty flexible when I have appointments or family emergencies or whatever to attend to. Not sure how Boeing compares in this regard.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really like to know how all these things compare to Boeing, but above all my concern is about being laid off. My current job is pretty stable and secure. I don't wanna start at Boeing and then get laid off after a few months and be shit outta luck, wishing I had stayed at my old job. Especially considering all the shit that's going on with the MAX at the moment, it's not exactly a comforting thought.

,"Hey folks. So this sub has not really been moderated until this year and we definitely need to clean up the guidelines to make it a bit clearer. Just making a quick notice for a common trend we have been seeing.

Posting video links is fine. Just refrain from overdoing it that you are reposting the same video; which will be viewed as spam. The other issue with a recently removed user is using throwaway to pretend you're a ""fan"" of your own channel.

The other post issue does have to do with the 737 max 8 topic. A civil discussion is fine. You may notice (or not) that majority 737 max 8 posts are deleted quickly but some do remain up. The ones that are being removed are posts with inflammatory titles or are done by users who have a history of using the very topic to troll our users.

For non-Boeing employees/contractors, you are welcome to start **civil discussions** with legitimate questions. Just please do keep in mind that Boeing is a large company with many projects. Details regarding a specific project is kept internal within the respective team. I wouldn't be surprised if we don't have regular users that are involved with the 737 max 8, let alone one that had anything to do with the current testing.

Also project details are limited to small group of people that it can be very easy to narrow down a user to a specific person. There are probably many details that Engineers on the 737 Max 8 would love to share to dispel most media coverage but are unable to do so.

Many of you are also doing a great job of reporting a lot of the aforementioned posts and I thank you for that. Thank you all for your time and being a member of this community.

Of course I did it right away and let both manger ""X"" and ""Y"" know. However, no reply so far after a week. I thought I would get a fast response as I assume this is a resumed hiring process and the manager directly contacted me. Am I just being too anxious and hopeful?? I guess so. Another thing is that when I applied, I indicated that this is through the referral of manager ""Y"" because he was the one who initially interviewed me in April, but not sure if that has killed my chance.

,"So long story short,

My career had a major turn around after I was a caregiver for 6 months  and still part time monitoring, for my mother who has had a bone marrow transplant. I had time to reflect had developed different interests of a career to pursue. I have lots of mechanical experience and work at the Boeing company in the past and have been waiting 14 months to get a position back at the company and recently got an email for an interview. I also have learned that in the past never to wait around for Boeing to get back to you in a timely manner, I had an interview for another position six months ago with no call back.

For a month-and-a-half after transitioning from being a caregiver for my mother, I was offered a technician job at a local Volkswagen dealership in Everett Washington. It isn't as good as I thought it would be for the fact that my opinion is flat rate is crippling the auto mechanic industry in some ways.

Last Sunday I got a email from Tesla offering an interview for a paid internship at the Tesla start program in shoreline community college. Tesla offers all the tools, full benefits and company stock upon graduation and job placement. 

What do I do? Do I pursue a new and exciting career with Tesla? Do I keep my fingers crossed and hope my Boeing interview is scheduled soon? It's been two weeks since they have reached out to me and would like to schedule an interview.

We feel like we aren‚Äôt respected and it‚Äôs a bit of a slap in the face when most of us have to then train our new manager. I‚Äôm so fed up about it that I‚Äôm going to try to get a new job and so are many of my colleagues throughout the country. Leadership doesn‚Äôt seem to notice or care about the turnover in our positions or that this is why. I think leaving Boeing at this point seems like the option for most of us and we are all really good and capable workers. For example, I‚Äôve been with the company 4 years and am a level 4. I‚Äôm always scored well as well and hear I do amazing at my job. I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do now because my manager is leaving and I get the feeling I‚Äôm not even being considered even though there are only the two of us at our site. So they‚Äôll likely bring in an outside person I will have to train on a lot of things who will oversee me and one other colleague at another site who also is wondering why I‚Äôm not the obvious choice. It just seems like such a messed up culture to never promote from within and after seeing a colleague at another state go through this where she worked in her role for 15 years, then a manager position was being created in her state, she interviewed and didn‚Äôt get it... then she trained her new manager... I don‚Äôt want to go through this too. It‚Äôs really a shame P levels seem expendable.",/r/boeing/comments/d0ffif/advancing_at_boeing_impossible_in_my_department/,364,1871

,"Hi, I was hoping someone on here might help me talk out my career plans. 

I have a bachelor's degree in environmental science and am currently working assembly on the floor. It's ok but I'm finding myself bored and tired of the mindless repetitiveness. 

I've hoping to move towards a job that will challenge me and give me opportunities to use my education or perform problem-solving.  Unfortunately I haven't seen any entry-level environmental testing/safety jobs in the last 6 months. I've also applied to a few entry-level engineering jobs (thoughts on industrial engineers or QA specialists?) but have yet to even get an interview. Even though I have my foot in the door with Boeing, do I even stand a chance competing against people with direct experience and/or degrees in that area?

I'd like to take advantage of earning a master's with the LTP program but I'm having a hard time narrowing it down. I know I want to study something that will be more employable than my environmental science degree was. I'm intrigued by engineering but also acknowledge that while I killed it in biology/chemistry, calculus was a struggle for me. Would a master's in engineering be extremely math heavy or do you cover most of that in undergrad? I imagine I'd have to take quite a few pre-reqs....   

I'd love to hear people's thoughts on specific master's as a jumping off point for my research.

,"I am a SPEEA represented engineer working in Everett. I have been having a discussion about level upgrade with my manager since the beginning of this year. In general she has been dragging her feet on every step of the process and I have had to push her to each next step. Finally at my interim PM she told me the decision had been made to grant my upgrade and that she just needed to determine the effective date and salary adjustment which she planned to do the following week. It has been nearly two months since the decision was made, but the upgrade has still not gone through. My manager claims this is due to ""a snag in Workday"" but hasn't provided any details or timeframe for resolution. I am still relatively new to the company (\~1.5 years) and this is my first level upgrade so I am not very familiar with this process. 

What are my options? Should I take this to my Senior Manager or HR and ask for help getting the upgrade through? I've also considered asking SPEEA for help since based on the SJC tasks and my ETS records, I can prove that 70%+ of my time has gone toward higher-level work for over 1 year.  

To complicate matters I am planning on leaving my position in the next few months because my wife accepted a new job offer that will have us leaving Washington. I'm in job hunting mode but not sure when I will be leaving my position. It seems that the common advice is to not provide any notice to your current employer until you have a firm offer in hand (to avoid potentially being let go before you intend to leave). Since I am fairly well protected from wrongful firing by SPEEA it seems like that would not be a concern in my case, and providing more notice will help my team with staffing planning.

- the Mods got shirty with me for posting the above and removed the post about stopping production because it didn't lead to conversation, despite 15 comments.

- American took an enormous hit of almost $200 million for the quarter.  They are blaming the 737 MAX which is only partially true.   A dispute with one of two mechanics unions they have is also throwing a monkey-wrench into the gears as this union continues to delay flights.

- Southwest has said they don't expect the 737 MAX to fly until 2020

- the stock has taken one almight ****-kicking this week and is down worst weekly performance since the crash

- the FAA has said they will only certify in conjunction with Europe, Brazil and Canada. 

- 3 test flights have had problems.   Two experienced the same issues as Lion Air 610 and Ethiopian 302 during take off on a test flight from Everett to Moses Lake, a third declared an emergency landing intent to Victoria over the Straight of Juan de Fuca during high altitude testing of climb/dive scenarios.

- the Max was the fastest selling plane in its history and the company expected to deliver between 895 and 905 airplanes this year.  Now it has become the most costly plane in Boeing‚Äôs history.

- Muilenberg continues to grumble and groan about the slow certification process while blaming foreign pilots.   Absolutely nobody can see his point on the slowness of certifying the jet as he has lost all credibility by blaming foreigners for crashing the jet instead of accepting blame.

,"If you are learning **[TIG welding](http://www.danscertifiedwelding.com/tig-welding)** strategies or are just trying to be a TIG welder, the last point that needs to come near speed is the hand feeding the rod. In kindergarten, most of us discovered the best ways to hold a huge pastel and also this is not too different from holding a TIG lantern.

If the hand that feeds the filler pole is a bit of a slow-moving learner, a really thin glove helps. If you‚Äôre having issues really feeling the wire, attempt mechanical gloves or woven cotton hand-wear covers. Below are a lot more techniques as well as ideas to help you out.

TIG Welding Techniques
======================

### Pick the Right-Size TIG Welding Pole

For sheet metal approximately 1/8-inch thick, do not utilize a welding pole bigger than the density of the metal you‚Äôre _[welding](http://www.danscertifiedwelding.com)_. The amperage is reduced as well as the weld puddle should be little to stop blowing a hole.

When you dip the pole right into the puddle, the rod draws the warm from the pool, making it tough to preserve a consistent dimension bead. It is best that newbies need to not exercise with slim metal.

### TIG Lantern Handle Should be 10 Levels or Less

Ideally, the torch angle should just determine around 10 levels or less. If you have too much lantern angle, the warmth will certainly be deflected and also the pole will certainly melt even before you get involved in the puddle.

This will certainly trigger the rod to ball up as well as blog into the puddle. You wish to slip the filler rod right into the pool so you get a regular bead. Exemptions to this consist of when you‚Äôre using an ordinary cord technique and also are leaning the torch back while you stroll the cup.

### Never ever Let a Sphere Type at the Rod End

If this takes place, you are doing glitch. It could be because, you are looking an arc that‚Äôs also long, excessive torch angle, bad filler pole angle, inadequate amperage or a mix of these points.

One of the most common of these among newbies are utilizing too much torch angle as well as well long an arc. A long arc implies warm is not concentrated as well as you get this huge heated arc plume like you would get with a gas soldering iron.

### Thoriated Tungsten Electrodes are Contaminated

Many individuals state 2% thoriated tungsten electrodes are gently contaminated, however 2% lanthanated electrodes are just as excellent as 2% thoriated. So if you are frightened if thoriated tungsten yet you are much more scared of crappy electrodes that don‚Äôt work as well, usage 2% lanthanated (they are tinted blue).

Bear in mind that the blue ones are not brittle like 2% thoriated electrodes. Additionally, they splinter if you attempt to damage them or trim with dykes.

Lindblad, a respected engineer who had also run the 777X wide-body programme, has been with Boeing for about 34 years and had mentioned retiring last year.

Safety Information Cards have caused Southwest Airlines no end of strife with nervous fliers ""bombarding"" flight attendants with questions if they were on the design flawed aircraft.

Buying into the (incorrect) Boeing sales pitch to airline companies that Pilots do not need any Simulator time and merely need a 50 minute iPad course on the *new and improved* 737, Boeing also had a combined Safety Information Card rolled out to ~~suckers~~ airline companies who bought the plane.

This backfired recently on Southwest Airlines, who is the largest user of the very safe and reliable 737 but also has 34 of the 737-Max aircraft which have caused two crashes recently by overriding all Pilot instruction and flying headfirst into Terra Firma killing all on board.

To date, nobody has survived a 737-Max crash.

Southwest Airlines had been sold an improved aircraft so went ahead with the plan to have a combined 737 and 737-Max Safety Information Card.   This backfired spectacularly when nervous passengers thought they were on the doomed aircraft.   Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok users all sent questions ranging from calm to near hysterical upon finding a 737-Max safety card in the seat back pocket.

Rather than blame foreign pilots (Boeing) or work with Europe, Brazil and Canada to approve a solution (FAA) Southwest immediately......................**and quietly** printed new Safety Information Cards with the 737-MAX removed.

,"$185 Million is what AA is claiming in lost revenue.   The cancelled flights, the grounding of aircraft, the storage of these design-flawed clunkers, the bookings goint to airlines that fly reliable planes................all added up to $185 in an income miss for AA.

Now, AA may have shaded these numbers a bit hoping to get either a discount on future planes or some compensation from Boeing and the whole announcement cheerily deflects/ignores their own fight to the death with their mechanics union who are grounding flights intentionally for made up reasons to pressure AA into signing a new deal.   Personally I feel AA's problems are their own internal one's and the 737-Max is a great example of never missing an opportunity blame some else............anyone else.

However, it must be said that AA has said they are cancelling 115 flights a day because of the poorly designed 737-Max and it's infamous MCAS system.  

http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2019/The-Latest-Information-About-737-MAX-Operations/default.aspx

The real alarm bells for Boeing should be............AA only has 24 planes!!!!  Twenty Four of these POS aircraft that catapult innocent passengers and crew into the ground all notwithstanding the brave efforts of the Flight Crew.     24 planes has (as per AA's description) caused a $185 dollar hit to the bottom line.

United ordered 100 of these aircraft previously. 
https://www.boeing.com/commercial/customers/united-airlines/historic-order-of-100-737-maxs-and-50-next-generation-737s.page

Alaska Airlines has one imminently awaiting delivery and already painted (I cannot prove this but know it)

..........and poor Southwest.   Poor Southwest has 34 Max's sitting around some tarmac gathering dust while rivals with air worthiness certificates fly passengers all over the country/world.



There are 371 737-Max's that have been delivered to ~~suckers~~ airlines around the world.   Let us say, just for the sake of argument that AA is correct and we will use really loose math here.     24 737-MAX planes that AA have make up 6% of the worlds fleet.     Using AA math that means airlines have lost $1.96 **BILLION** in revenue.

Now, to be fair, a large amount of that $1.96 Billion will go to other airlines who didn't buy a 737-Max, but if you think the airlines that lost out on that revenue care that another airline simply soaked up that revenue..........you are right.  They will care.  They will care a lot.

Boeing may or may not have $1.96 Billion sitting in a slush fund waiting to pay back airline companies.   But that number is for Q2.   Q2 is over, we are already in Q3.   This compound math is becoming a big problem.   Don't forget someone is going to be looking at compensation for the deaths of 346 people.

There will be a lot of cost cutting coming due to heavy, heavy discounts, payouts and fees.

In my humble opinion, Boeing's biggest problem comes from the fact that the FAA has (for reasons which have not been satisfactorily explained to me) agreed to work with the EASA to certify the aircraft.   Now the FAA already has agreements with the Brazilian and Canadian air safety agencies.   This was due to Brazil building Embraer and Canada building Bombardier and entering into a shared rules agreement with Canada.    The long and the short of it is the US and Canada adopt the same rules.  An iconoclast would say that Canada gets the full intelligence and mechanism of the FAA without the costs but so be it.

I recently applied to the ITCFP internal requisition about a week ago. I have a couple of questions regarding the application and interview process as well as the pay range and specifics of the program.

1). How long does the application/interview phase take? I will be returning to my university at the end of this summer and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôll know whether I got the position before the end of my internship.

2). Do you just apply online and they select from there or is there an in-person/WebEx interview as well? 

3). The pay grade listed on SJCS lists the pay in very odd, huge ranges compared to other Comp charts. Does ITCFP follow the general Boeing trend of paying recent college grads somewhere around .75-.85 of the mid value for that specific location? 

4). Do you have a matching event for your rotations in ITCFP or are there 4 specific IT areas that are already pre-selected for everyone?",/r/boeing/comments/cb2qk3/itcfp_questions/,163,932

,"Saudi airline FlyaDeal has cancelled a firm order for 20 737 Max's and a provisional order of 30 737 Max's.

https://www.flyadeal.com/en/

The list price for 50 737 Max's is $5.9 Billion.   The real kick in the shins is FlyaDeal will buy A320's instead.     

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48899588

This speaks more to the corporate mismanagement of this whole situation rather than the plane itself as the plane has been grounded since March.    FlyaDeal operates in the most pro-US jurisdiction in the Arab world and is very pro Boeing.

...............we need to figure this out.  Many of you have sent me and other posters who point out the inadequices of the handling of this situation as trolls or s***-disturbers.    We cannot simply circle the wagons and hope the problem goes away.  It is not going away.  This plane has a design flaw.   Larger engines are situated on a different position on the wing, the $9 dollar an hour coders can write all the programs they want but the MCAS, in fact the entire flight command needs work.    We have to do better.    

This is starting to circle the drain here.   We need to get on top of this.   All the software updates, the reboots and the warm assurances from top level management cannot overlook the fact the company is silo'ed.     

This is becoming a pivotal moment for Boeing.    Bombardier (now Airbus A220), COMAC, Mitsubishi, Sukhoi are all getting to the point or have gotten to the point of releasing a newer, better, more fuel efficient short to medium haul jet.

1  working at unguarded highest up to 4 feet .
2 working around dangerous machinery.
3 work in isolated areas.
4 work in confined space.
5 drive company vehicle.

I have read online on the gov website for safety and above 4 feet you need safety stuff to prevent accidents. Employers must work within a reasonable means to ensure employment without it being a major struggle or inconvenience on the company.

,"Tajikistan's Somon Air has ~~walked~~ run away from plans to lease the 737 Max.   Concern about the timeline to re-entry of service, shattered public confidence in the model and fears of seeing its crew and customers plummet head first into the ground, plagured Somon Air.

The 737MAX was due to be leased from Air Lease Corp and should have already been ferrying passengers around the Somon Air network.   The airline was the main competitor to Tajik Air and had a fairly good safety record with air worthiness certificates for 13 countries and the EU.

Boeing has struggled to regain confidence after growing concerns about how it downplayed the severity of the problem, lobbied the US government to allow to keep flying and blaming foreign pilots for crashes they could not avoid.

This follows Garuda (Lion Air's largest competitor) and Azerbaijan Airlines walking away from the troubled aircraft.

I just accepted an offer recently and just started my background check. I got involuntarily separated from the military for drug abuse.

,"So last week, after a long and annoying process with the background check (suffice to say I'm not a fan of HireRight), my recruiter finally emails me a few start dates to choose from. One of which is next Friday June 28th, which is ideal. The other dates are way less so - one I'm unavailable for and the other is a month from now. 

She wrote that I should reply to her with my selection along with which form of identification I'll use for I-9 paperwork. I replied 20 minutes after I received the email..... And I haven't heard from her since. I've tried calling and it always goes straight to voicemail. There's no updated tasks in taleo or follow up emails like her email said I'd get when my start date is confirmed so I'm assuming she hasn't read my email nor received my voicemail. 

So am I screwed and have to wait a full month? I suppose it's a good thing I didn't give notice to my current employer because I wanted it to be ""confirmed"" - even though her email said ""you may now give notice to your current employer.""

,"So I live in North Carolina and received an offer on May 8th to work at the Renton facility. My new position directly involves the 737 max. The first week post offer, I received a bunch of paper work (background check, drug screen etc.) regarding my contingencies. I completed everything in a timely manner and then I was left in the dark for about 5 weeks....

My ""recruiter"" would not communicate with me at all despite me trying to contact him multiple times via email and phone. After 5 weeks and  absolutely nothing from my recruiter, I ended up contacting the woman from global staffing who set up my drug screen for an update. She then tells me my start date is on June 28th....two weeks from now. 

As you may know, the welcome letter states to not put in a two week notice at current job, or adjust living arrangements until the recruiter tells you that all the contingencies are cleared. Thankfully my offer includes moving assistance, so at least that will be taken care of. But, needless to say, I was not prepared for this process to go this way. 

I did not have my hiring managers contact info until this week. This whole time I thought something was very wrong; either I didn't pass my background check, hiring freeze due to the max situation, etc.  I discussed this with my hiring manager and she is aware that it is not my fault but I still need to report on the 28th.

So point of the story: if a few weeks go by and you can't contact your recruiter, do whatever you can to get ahold of someone. My situation is a huge mess but I still can't wait to start my career with Boeing.",/r/boeing/comments/c0yzm1/my_hiring_process/,297,1597

,"How long does it typically take to hit level 2 if you're hired fresh out of college?  

I know the usual figure is 2 years but I'm wondering if anyone's done it sooner, perhaps maybe even in a year. The reason I ask is because I've been given a lot of opportunities on this particular team (mostly due to it being a newer team without significant structures/processes in place) to perform at a level 2 function for the past 1-2 months (been here 5) and according to several of my coworkers and my PO, I've taken really good advantage of them and have been performing at a particularly high level for a new hire in the time since I started. I don't think I could have made this much progress on a normally structured team or even with a different statement of work, but I've found the challenges we have to be pretty exciting and I haven't been afraid to put in quite a bit of overtime as well (which my boss has gone out of his way to let me know he appreciates very much). Besides the normal stuff of being quick to learn, a good presence in the office, taking on more responsibilities as they come up, etc.  

I want to approach my boss with this question/proposal at a tagup meeting in a few weeks but I want to be sure I'm not talking out of my ass if I make my stance known to him. I should add that I've been taking careful notes of my performance every other week or so and how specifically they align to the level 2 functions in SJCS, and I've also worked hard to work an impactful side project outside of our specific team that caught the attention of our second level manager and her team - she's working directly with me and a fellow new hire to implement our ideas at the organization level and as a result I have a very solid relationship with her and the rest of the first line managers underneath her in our org. I feel like a have a fairly strong case to present for him as we continue with the year, but I'm hoping someone in the comments can give me their own personal experience so I have additional perspectives beyond my own team, or hopefully I get a nice cold dose of reality to bring me back down to earth. Or maybe someone can give me positive news. Either way works :)

One last question, let‚Äôs say I own an airline, and I‚Äôm making an order through Boeing on a 787. Could I request a total cockpit change on the aircrafts?

,"My friend and I did some quick calculations the other day after hearing for the nth time that ""oh I have a friend who works at Amazon and he makes like $120k.""  

We actually came to a pretty cool conclusion based on the fact that most workers on Amazon are working on average 50 hour weeks (perhaps more but let's assume 50).  

If you're in SPEEA and you're an entry level engineer making $78,000 (which is about the average) and you work 10 hours of overtime each week, given that SPEEA workers have no 'gate' hours and overtime pay is time + $6.50, **that actually will bump up your annual salary to $100,880** as an entry level engineer, which is kind of crazy.  

Of course this rests on the assumption that you're in SPEEA and your department is actually able to approve you for 10 hours of overtime every week, but this is a cool thought experiment nonetheless and it's fun to tell your friends that you would be making 6 figures if you worked similar schedules to Amazon or Microsoft.",/r/boeing/comments/bw6n1w/a_quick_note_on_puget_sound_area_engineering/,181,993

&amp;#x200B;

I asked what the next steps were and they said I'd hopefully hear back next week. Well, this week has come and gone and I know it was optimistic thinking they would get back to me that fast given the holiday weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

The same day as my interview (Friday) Taleo went from under consideration to interview completed, it was then updated again on Tuesday and one more time on Wednesday. From looking at this subreddit this seems like it is a good sign? The only downfall is this job explicitly says no relocation offered, non negotiable. I live in the midwest so I am wondering if anyone has been able to change their mind on this. I realize it is an entry level position and I don't have a lot of negotiating power but the job is for a very specific division that I had experience with in college. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; 

\- Taleo has been updated 3 times after phone interview, is this a good sign?

I have a question about what it looks like as a normal day at work for someone who works as an aircraft maintenance technician /inspector in Washington. I do not have AP yet but am studying and plan on having it by December although no where in my resume does it say I have it.

Can anyone explain what the interview is like? Is it a large panel? How long does it take ? I heard there are only 6 questions.

How important is previous leadership experience in the position?

How much of the day is working on the jet as opposed to doing paperwork/ getting tools / etc?

If hired, after the interview, what is the expected report no later than to work?

Anything not asked but mentioned is greatly appreciated. I have always been looking forward to working for Boeing. As a kid,driving past the Everett plan I would always look out the window and think about it and how cool airplanes are. My understanding is this position is a flightline job.

This is just scary.

,"I am posting here because I despair of communicating this anywhere else. It's like screaming into a hurricane.

&amp;#x200B;

I have read the interim report on Ethiopian 302 very carefully. I have studied the data in the report. The facts, such as we have at this point, are clear: there was a runaway trim situation arising shortly after takeoff due to a faulty AOA sensor.

&amp;#x200B;

The flight crew had a complete and correct memory checklist for this situation in the flight manual. They had an additional bulletin prepared after Lion Air 610. Both of these described precisely the situation encountered by the pilots.

&amp;#x200B;

While dealing with this problem, the pilots discontinued their climb and levelled off, but they did not retard the throttles from takeoff power. In consequence, the aircraft experienced an overspeed in the range of 50kts for approximately the last 2.5 minutes of flight.

&amp;#x200B;

The pilots eventually disabled the electric trim, but they had trouble controlling the aircraft manually because of excessive control forces. They were either unable to set the trim manually due to aerodynamic forces from the overspeed, or else they were not sufficiently aggressive in setting the trim manually.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly before the end of the flight, they re-enabled the electric trim despite the checklist specifically saying not to do so. The MCAS was then able to direct the electric trim to the full AND position. This was a terminal event because of the overspeed.

&amp;#x200B;

This clear and factual narrative was flatly and unsupportably contradicted by the conclusion of the preliminary report, which can only represent a CYA move.

&amp;#x200B;

Any properly-trained pilot should be able to overcome a single component failure when an effective memory checklist and a recent specific AD or bulletin is available. There was time, opportunity, altitude and airspace to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

I can therefore think of only two reasons for the tidal wave of FUD aimed at Boeing by the media:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) There are no ethical fact-based journalists left and they are all making up stories for maximum shock value and as click bait; or

&amp;#x200B;

(2) The Russian troll factory in St. Petersburg has been given orders to attack Boeing in order to destabilize NATO.

&amp;#x200B;

,"I watched a documentary about the DC-10 a while ago, and remember that it was grounded for a month or so in 1979. The DC-10 was grounded due to a single crash that was caused by poor maintenance. Back in 1979, there was no internet, and I'm assuming information about the plane didn't spread as much as with the internet. However, it does seem like the incident did tarnish the image of McDonnell-Douglas and trijets altogether. 

So with that in mind, is the 737 MAX grounding worse than the DC-10 grounding in 1979? And will it leave a worse impression of the 737 in the future?

From my understanding, since we do have the internet, and more advanced technology, more people have heard about the 737 MAX crashes. The 737 MAX crashed because of a big design error, and not a maintenance issue. The media said that the cause of the bad design fault was because of profit being more important than safety, in the competition with the A320NEO. Also, the DC-10 was rebranded as the MD-11 when they designed the successor variant to the DC-10; but the MD-11 still didn't sell very well. I suspect that Boeing may have to let go of the 1960s 737 brand and plane, and will need to come up with a completely modernized and new design for a 737 replacement after the MAX.

Therefore another will happen in the future. It may be several decades before this happens again. But it will. And I REFUSE to put myself at the mercy of ignorant corporations, and federal ‚Äúsafety mediators‚Äù such as the FAA.

,"Hey guys, as title says, I was just hired on at the everett facility and I am looking to move later this month.

So I'm looking around the area for a new apartment, and here's what I'm sort of looking for.

1) Asian &amp; younger (mid-late 20's) community (Korean)   
2) Max 40 min commute to/back work  (including traffic)  
3) budget of 1600/mo (1bed)  
4) Safe Neighborhood  


 So I've done some research and narrowed it down to Lynnwood, Bothell, Kirkland, Bellevue, Redmond.

In the past , I didn't care too much about criminal rate (I live in a really safe neighborhood  atm), and the more I researched, the crime rate around Seattle seems to be a lot worse than what I had imagined, according to news/journalism. And is why I'm making this post.

,"Today marked the start of the new intern season! Congratulations to all those that made it! I'm a two time Engineer intern with Boeing and have been working full time for about a year now. I thought I'd drop some advice that nobody asked for! Hope this sets some of you up for success; or something to look forward to if you are starting in the next couple weeks (Looking at you Quarter system interns).

**Attend social/networking event**
Most common ones will be the ones that are organized by your intern coordinator. I still have a lot of connection that I made during my internships and despite all of us spreading out to different sites, we still keep in touch and make time to see each other when we can. Also these events have tons of free food.

Boeing also has an organization called REACH, which provides social gathering for young employees. These are open to interns as well and great place to network with other Boeing employees. There are tons of lunch and learns and community volunteer events as well.

**Be ambitious! Reach out!**
Boeing greatly values the intern program. Dennis Muilenburg (CEO) and many managers and technical fellows at Boeing were interns themselves. You would be surprised by how many people are willing to help you out.

In my example, during my first internship, I established connection with various managers, technical fellows, and executives just simply by sending a pleasant e-mail and asking for an interview. In the case of the exec, he scheduled and sent me the meeting request himself!

**Use Insite**
Boeing has an internal directory and social website called ""Insite"". Use it to find and contact people you are interested in talking to. This is also where you can sign up for newsletter, join groups, and see upcoming events.

**Don't be afraid to mess up and ask questions**
""Impostor Syndrome"" is a very common thing, and is especially true for Engineer interns. Just keep in mind that no intern really knows what they are doing, and nobody expects you to know much. Your technical mentor is there to help you learn the job, and don't be afraid of looking stupid.

I married a man here locally and now my pay is no longer from Russia making my pay higher. I also had a child this winter. 

My benefits are changing greatly and I am so grateful. Yet this is making problems with my coworkers and friends as the Russian community and Boeing‚Äôs Russian community is a family as well. 

My husband has made some great mistakes but I love him. Yet he‚Äôs lied about many things and I am in fear of his past and not being honest may have me deported. He has told some people who don‚Äôt like him the baby is not his biological child and I am not going to discuss anything else in regards to my child. He has lied about our life and it‚Äôs causing me stress because of his  cheating while we married until recently and we never told his family here about the marriage and very few people who are Americans who know him. His ex and other child‚Äôs mother is who he had been cheating with and she never knew until she caught him and told his parents. He now has a lot of legal issues but is a lawyer and she is going to tell immigration we are sure. She also has all the lies he told her that she believed.

first reddit post ever! I've been reading posts on this subreddit for about 3 weeks now, so I know this question gets asked A LOT. I just need some encouraging words because I'm going crazy waiting for any signs of life. I interviewed by phone for an engineering position in San Antonio, TX 3 weeks ago today.

Applied for position- early January 2019

received email to set up interview- early April

&amp;#x200B;

The status on my Taleo page said ""under consideration"" since the moment I submitted my application.  My interview went well, it lasted about an hour and 10 minutes approx.

My Taleo status changed to ""interview completed"" a couple days ago, so at least I know they are actually doing SOMETHING, and if they were no longer interested they would just have sent that dreaded  "" Unfortunately you weren‚Äôt selected for this role"" email.

," **Boeing 737 Max:**

&amp;#x200B;

The issues with the 737 Max is not exactly to do with the placement of the Engine or rather the Software itself (Let me explain the software bit in the explanation) and or even, the pilot's that drive them or anything other than the business that you may think is the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

**I got people saying the following:**

&amp;#x200B;

* The issue is the software; Software has too high of a chance of failure and Boeing should rely on their pilots rather than software.
* The issue is the pilots; Software has a low chance of failure and Boeing should not fully rely on human correction.
* The issue is the Engine placement; The Engine is too high for the 737 Max to fly properly.
* The issue is the Wings; The wings do not function properly so that's why where the engine is it causes the nose to raise too much.
* So on so forth

The real issue does not lie on anything above or even fully on the software. If Boeing gave adequate time to conduct full extensive testing of the software along with putting together an entire (100% ideal) training program things would have turned out much differently.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, they decided to cut corners to get the quick cash, which in turn caused lives and even money. If they learned one thing from this I hope it is that cutting corners to earn cash can easily do the opposing of what is intended.

&amp;#x200B;

Software is not a dangerous thing if you don't allow it to be, in other words; If you fully debug and take out the kinks (To the best of human ability) you will have a much safer flight that does not rely fully on pilot's; pilot's are human and humans make mistakes. The software will work as intended for the most part as long as you did your appropriate amount of debugging and testing. I will say however that yes, software can mess up and it at times can be of issue, but this is far and in between in comparison to human error if you did like I said many times adequate testing and debugging.

&amp;#x200B;

I would never say software is without a doubt bug free or even fully reliable, but I will confidently say that software is absolutely without a doubt more reliable than human's. If you give appropriate time to debug/flush out error's/kinks in the program/software you will in return have a more adequate and safer option to rely on then having the pilot to rely on.

&amp;#x200B;

The blame also does not fully lie on Boeing, I know they are the ones to rush the release of the 737 Max but they also had it inspected and the FAA should have checked everything to make sure it is up for the task; people's lives are at stake and that should not be taken lightly.

&amp;#x200B;

***NOTE: Boeing and FAA cut corners to get the 737 Max into service before deadly crashes. In other words, the FAA also has reason to be blamed.***

&amp;#x200B;

**NEVER CUT CORNERS WHEN PEOPLE'S AND FAMILIES ARE AT STAKE, KILLING ONE PERSON DOES NOT ONLY AFFECT THAT PERSON BUT A FAMILY. IN THIS CASE HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES!**

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: I know I said kink's, debug, rely, safer and etc. often, but this is the best way to explain to you.

&amp;#x200B;

**NOTE:**

&amp;#x200B;

Just remember relying on a human is not the best means of safety, if you wish to have the most safe and secure way of doing things software is the way to go... but NEVER do the following.

&amp;#x200B;

* Rush Software
* Rush Training Procedures
* Rush Testing
* ETC

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

&amp;#x200B;

The issue lies on Boeing rushing out the plane to compete with their rivals (Airbus) and the FAA for allowing Boeing and themselves to cut corners. The issues does not lie on the software or even Engine Placement the reason it does not is because with adequate time for testing you would be able to adjust for that change either by software or by changes to the plane as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

Software is something of which people use due to the amount of added safety software can give that human's can not. If you do not give adequate time to test the software that entire aspect of the software being safe can be an absolute disaster.

If you feel I missed something or said something that may be wrong and or worded weirdly feel free to discuss that in the comments, I am open to change the post if other's take something in a way I did not intend on saying.

I am open for discussion and debate, I am open minded on almost if not all matters; feel free to voice your opinion. I am however going to say Boeing and the FAA should be reliable for everything that happened and there should be something put in place to prevent such a thing from happening again.

I used marijuana frequently (at night) and my last time using it was on April 3rd when I got the call.

If I do get an offer next week, can I request one week to review the offer (to have more clean days to get the THC out of my system), or does Boeing require a drug test within two days of an offer?

Remember at the end of the movie, the B-17 Bomber was flying with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating ONLY ONE WING? Why didn‚Äôt the plane immediately drop to one side? What about the real life examples where *ALL* engines  failed and the massive plane was able to turn 180 degrees and return safely to the ground? (Read: Miracle on the Hudson cited at the end of the OP for an example). Have to agree after the last few crashes that something mysterious is failing within these planes, right? I mean, it's not an led light that's the problem here.
#The Big Secret: 
Electromagnetic technology secretly keeps the planes afloat once the (noisy) jet engines are running, while propellers are only used to move the plane forward. EM is 10\^39 more powerful than Gravity, thus anti-gravity technology is trivial and simple to design, and was invented a very long time ago. Starting in WW2, this technology was built into the planes in such a way that their own pilots and engineers did not realize it. This was the only way they could get these TEENAGE PILOTS into the planes and send them hundreds of miles on bombing raids. Allied bombing raids using child pilots is the inspiration behind the book Ender's Game. Older vets would have objected to the global air-force bombings, and they still do today, thus all pilot decision making has been replaced by AUTOMATED DRONE AI. Smaller stunt planes do not need such technology to fly (many still use it, as do all drone bombers), but all Boeing Bombers (i.e. B17, B52) absolutely did since they needed to carry a major payload (unlimited weight) in bombs. These automated over-sized cargo bombers were responsible for over 15 million deaths during the 20th century as they dropped Napalm and other incendiary bombs over 3 thousand human cities towns and villages. Had the allies used normal anti gravity technology to win the war, they would have sent the Memphis Belle boys in flying saucers. The pilots would be well aware of the technology by the end of the war, and we'd all be in our own saucers today. 
#The only reason 
to build an airplane that could never fly by aerodynamic technology alone *IS* to hid the technology from the very pilots who are winning the Allies war. Can you agree that saturated air bombing won WW2? All those houses in that movie The Pianist? 67 Cities in Japan, etc etc. This is how we won WW2. We CHEATED! This is how NAZI Germany, North Korea, Japan (and more recently) Vietnam and Yugoslavia were completely destroyed. This is why you CANNOT get an aviators license without DIRECT APPROVAL by the FAA, which requires a written and oral test proving that you 'understand' (believe in) aerodynamics heavier-than-air flight. This is why the NASA/Boeing boys club has always been so corrupted. This is why NASA is fake, created entirely in-house by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. This is why Jumbo Jets have not improved in design in over 70 *YEARS*. This is why all Jumbo Jets look identical. This is why they NEVER CRASH (with the exception of a major uptick in unexplained crashes since 2014). This is why 9/11 involved (cgi) Jumbo Jets and turned airports into PRISONS. This explains ALL UFO SIGHTINGS. This explains CHEMTRAILS (No human pilots required). Consider that this is the secret NSA (and recently TSA) were created to protect. This is why basically everything you know about the ruinous 20th century, our darkest century. How does one keep such an obvious secret this whole time? Any country that doesn't go along with 'the plan' gets bombs instead of airports.

# By Endless War.
Oh, wait, what's that? Allies were the 'good guys'? Victors of war never tell a lie? Holocaust wasn't a giant hoax? Save it.

A: that wasn't a question.

Q: Why do people like you post these everywhere and even get banned and shunned for it? 
A: Because we believe as soon as the world realizes this one thing about airplanes, we can start the healing process from 100 years of endless war. Doesn't that sound good?

Q: No seriously, WHY are you doing this?
A: If you can't tell, there is a serious epidemic of censorship destroying the internet we used to know.

For reference, my professional experience is in engineering design and R&amp;D, with many years in retail/other management as I worked through school.  Long term goals are to move into a Project Engineer or other engineering leadership role.  My current thinking on the various groups hiring are as follows:

Training Systems and Government Services has the fewest employees and that might provide some opportunities to take on different roles simultaneously, adding some diverse experience to my skill set.  However the smaller number of employees might limit advancement opportunities.

BGS was described on this forum as a meritocracy, not reliant on large government contracts like BDS.  Almost as many employees as BDS, so maybe lots of advancement opportunities.  Honestly this group sounds pretty awesome, if I'm as talented as I think I am lol.

BDS looks to be the largest group, so maybe the most roles to advance into.  They also work on some of the worlds coolest stuff, so if I had to be limited in upward mobility there could be worse places to be stuck at.  Also maybe a little more volatile, but most likely not an issue at my location.

Sorry to post a contingency question (I know these are very common and quite redundant), but I had a quick question. I've been offered and accepted a position in Everett, and right now I'm in the background and drug screening section. I got the email for that on March 12, and gave my sample for drug screening two days after and finished my HireRight stuff on the 19th. My HireRight report had 1 discrepancy that they didn't notify me about with my University dining service work I did where they only got details of employment til July of 2014, but I claimed Nov 2014 as my end date (because I wasn't aware a second company was paying me for my job at the stadium, even though I get one paycheck). Anyways notified my HR and contingency rep right away about that and they said not to worry, if the security team has questions they'll get in touch. Other than that everything they were able to validate, I have a clean record and don't do any sort of drugs so I'm not worried about that either.

My question arises in that I was told it takes 2-3 weeks from the day the email was sent on March 12. Now it's April 2 which is exactly 3 weeks. I'm wondering if anyone would know if there's something of a concern or is that normal?

I am  going through the onboarding process right now. I recently completed my drug screening at Quest in the next city over from where I am currently living.  I urinated about 45-50 mins before the test and I may have hydrated too much (1 and a half plastic water bottles) as I am currently fighting a really bad cold ( I do not do drugs btw, I know what this sounds like). The man who administered my drug test said there is a chance that I may have to re-test as my urine was clear and he said it may be too diluted.

Has anyone ever had to re-take? I am currently about to take a long road trip on vacation, and I am freaking out that Boeing will reach out to me while I am traveling this upcoming weekend and not able to find a Quest location open on weekends and that this may put my contingent offer in jeopardy.  I was told by the man at Quest that Boeing would reach out to me the next day if they needed a re-test, and so far they haven't so I guess that's a good sign.

My understanding is that to over come this autopilot can be switched off and manual control taken until the airspeed read error is resolved. The problem arises  when the pilots were not trained on this scenario and did not take the plane out of autopilot, thus ineffectively fighting against the nose dive until disaster. There can be many reasons for an airspeed sensor not functioning correctly and I think some investigation into why (something happening to sensors on ground or mid-flight; I know insects building nests in sensors have caused this problem in tropical locations before)  and ensuring comprehensive training is carried out by all airlines,  might prove more insightful to investigate this and mitigate in the future.

\#ConsiderThis: In all heavier-than-air jet planes (like Jumbo Jets), if one or multiple jet engines fail, only one jet engine is required stay in the air! There is no explanation yet from Boeing or NASA as to how Jumbo Jets can stay in the air with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating on ONE (not both) wings. Remember the movie Memphis Belle (1990)? Remember at the end of the movie, the B-17 Bomber was flying with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating ONLY ONE WING? Why didn‚Äôt the plane immediately drop to one side? The Big Secret: #AntiGravity (or Electromagnetic) technology secretly keeps the planes afloat once the (noisy) jet engines are running, while propellers are only used to move the plane forward. EM is 10\\\^39 more powerful than Gravity, thus anti-gravity technology is trivial and simple to design, and was invented a very long time ago. Starting in WW2, this technology was built into the planes in such a way that their own pilots and engineers did not realize it. This was the only way they could get these TEENAGE PILOTS into the planes and send them hundreds of miles on bombing raids. Older vets would have objected to the global air-force bombings, and they still do today, thus all pilot decision making has been replaced by AUTOMATED DRONE AI. Smaller stunt planes do not need such technology to fly (many still use it, as do all drone bombers), but all Boeing Bombers (i.e. B17, B52) absolutely did since they needed to carry a major payload (unlimited weight) in bombs. These automated over-sized cargo bombers were responsible for over 15 million deaths during the 20th century as they dropped Napalm and other incendiary bombs over 3 thousand human cities towns and villages. This is how we won WW2. This is how North Korea, Japan &amp; Vietnam were completely destroyed. This is why you CANNOT get an aviators license without DIRECT APPROVAL by the FAA, which requires a written and oral test proving that you understand 'aerodynamics'. This is why the NASA/Boeing boys club has always been so corrupted. This is why NASA is fake, created entirely in-house by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. This is why Jumbo Jets have not improved in design in over 70 \\\*YEARS\\\*. This is why all Jumbo Jets look identical. This is why they NEVER CRASH (with the exception of a major uptick in unexplained crashes around 2014) . This is why 9/11 involved (cgi) Jumbo Jets and turned airports into PRISONS. This explains ALL UFO SIGHTINGS. This explains CHEMTRAILS (No human pilots required). Consider that this is the secret NSA (and recently TSA) were created to protect. This is why basically everything you know about the ruinous 20th century, our darkest century. How does one keep such an obvious secret this whole time? Any country that doesn't go along with 'the plan' gets bombs instead of airports.

&amp;#x200B;

Clues for you:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Chronos/Satan/Yahwey/El is really Saturn (the planet), and Earth was one of it's moons (children) during all this cataclysm. Earth was a moon of Saturn (El). Saturn and the Great Planetary Conjunction was the GARDEN OF EDEN. Saturn and Jupiter hid the Sun and bathed baby Earth in buffered soft carbohydrate energy (manna). There were no seasons. Animals did not eat each-other. It was perfect. Suddenly, Earth was cast out into cataclysm and darkness. The rabbis told us it was punishment for sin. Both Jews and Sunni Islam still worship Saturn to this day as the Better Sun and insist no God (like Christ) should be worshiped before Saturn. They are crazy!

&amp;#x200B;

2. Christ is our Sun, not a human! Christ first appeared 2000 years ago rescuing the earth from darkness and terror, and causing all life to 'spring' back into existence. 2000 years ago Humans saw the Sun for the first time. Early Christianity was a Sun worship phenomenon centuries before the Romans turned it into a crucifixion death cult. Christianity was also WORLDWIDE, and existed in native form within EVERY CULTURE ON EARTH.

&amp;#x200B;

3.¬†Religion is Slavery: 6th Century, the Jews were losing their secretive Saturn-worship religion as Saturn was no longer visible or important and everyone was starting to worship the Sun (and has been for 6 centuries already). The Owners of Mecca at the time were Jews, and they owned slaves. Those Slaves left to Medina but every year they would Hajj to Mecca to pay tribute to their Saturnine Symbol of Yahweh/Allah: The Black Cube of Saturn. Thus Jews have been able to control their slaves world-wide through leaking bits of their secretive religion and claiming 'brotherhood' with their own slaves. In modern times, the Jews have completely lost control of Islam, and new domination such as those in Iran and Syria have a version of Islam that COMPLETELY REJECTS SATURN AS GOD. This was the #1 reason for WW1: Jews had to regain control over their old testament slaves, destroying the Ottoman empire that had existed peacefully for 6 centuries. WW2 was therefore a battle between the OTHER wayward slaves of the Jews; the Christians. In WW2, the Jew slave circumcised western Christians slaughtered the Sun worshiping German Christians. That's right. Jews invented Jesus, replacing Sun worship with a dead man on a cross around the same time: 6th century. Judaism and Sunni Islam are Saturnine religions. Most of our planet was Jewish BC. We all did Saturnalia and we still wear Saturn wedding rings. Marriage contracts are only for marrying off slaves!

&amp;#x200B;

4. Electromagnetic/Plasma forces rule the Universe, not Gravity. When planets war with each other, this is actually electromagnetism at work (plasma, really). They can consume one-another (and survive consummation), rip off their surfaces, and destroy each other with lightning. Planets are not Gods, but for all intents and purposes, to tiny humans they are. All humans on earth watched all of this happen. You couldn't avoid it, AND it really mattered in every day life.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Natural earth history is a Vatican lie started well before 1492 when they decided to conquer the world through religion and science. Jesuit Christianity (Focus on the human Jesus) was designed specifically to confuse and infiltrate the natives, and ultimately to enslave them. The earth is not BILLIONS of YEARS old. It's tens of thousands. It doesn't matter. Why? Because the length of a YEAR was not consistent before Year Zero. This is the reason the age ranges of Bible characters are larger the further back you go. Years were shorter and shorter going back to Eden when there were NO SEASONS.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

6. King David was the Planet Saturn. King Solomon is Sol (The Sun) i.e. Christ. The first Kingdom of Judah was not in the middle east, it was in HEAVEN (The Sky). King David ruled planet earth and would hurl massive mountains and crush the Giants. We know this story as David vs Goliath, but it wasn't the planets that killed the Giants. It was Communism, Commonism, Collectivism, Majorityism, Bolshevism, Elitism i.e. Judaism.

I also have many relatives still in India, like aunts/uncles, cousins, and grandparent. I've been reading how being a naturalized citizen or dual citizenship holder can significantly delay or even lead to a security clearance rejection. However I've been a naturalized citizen for the past 7 years and I've been living in the US since I was 3 years old, if that helps..

I started at Boeing Q4 last year as a level 3 analyst at a site in a smaller city, and have absolutely hated it so far(toxic coworkers + slow, easy and uninteresting line of work). I've tried what I can in attempt to make the situation better, however I've come to realize there isn't much more I can do. Ideally I'd really like to pursue a position at a different site in the West Coast before I start looking for outside opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I've seen a few posts related to my questions, but I wanted a clear answer on the below from someone who has completed an internal transfer.

* Is there a firm minimum amount of time you need to work before any managers considers you for a position? 
   * I have heard a year from some of my coworkers while some coworkers mentioned that only applies if you received relocation benefits.
* At what point does your current manager get notified that you have applied for another position? (assuming the hiring manager doesn't contact your current manager during the process)
* I'd also like insight from any of you who has dealt with a similar situation as mine and what you did to make things better.

Thanks!

,"So last night I submitted an application for the composite technician position. I am currently working 50 hours a week across two jobs so I was eager to apply for something to get myself out. I tried doing research on the position before applying, but I couldn't find anything online, so I have some questions for composite techs:

1. What do composite technicians for Boeing do? I kind of have a general idea of what I would be doing, but I have found many stories from different people working for different companies. A general rundown of what I will be doing every day will be great!

2. What can I expect for starting pay? Although I have been working a lot recently, the money has been good because I make $15.50/hr at Amazon and $18/hr after tips at my second job. 

3. On the application it said that I have to be able to work weekends and extended hours when necessary. How often does this happen? I wouldn't mind the extra work sometimes, but if I will be frequently working weekends that is a major turnoff for me as I think it is important to have my weekends off. Also, what are the hours usually like? Is this your typical 9-5 job?

Thank you guys for any responses! I do believe that this job will be a huge next step in my life as the work experience would be great and I have been considering getting into engineering, but I just want to know a little more about what I signed myself up for before any potential interviews. :)",/r/boeing/comments/ay4bav/questions_regarding_the_composite_tech_position/,269,1443

,"Hello Everyone,

The first thing I want to say is a HUGE thank you to everyone of this subreddit. You all have been extremely helpful in helping provide information and allowing me to talk through options and different considerations.

After about 2 years of applying and 3 interviews I finally have an offer on the table. I'm super excited to start the next part of this journey and make the most of it that I can. The offer is working as an Entry Level Software Engineer for international customers in the Training and Professional Services Division at Boeing St. Louis. Looks like I will be working in building 101 at the Berkeley facility. What I'm interested is what did you wish you had known before you have been working at Boeing? 

I've been authorized relocation benefits and will be looking to move to St. Louis after this semester of teaching. What are the best options in terms of living locations? I know I can use the St. Louis subreddit to help locating a good neighborhood to live in, but I'm interested in living in a loft in an area that has some night life to it and lots of things to do. I'm considering CWE, University City, or Maryland Heights but I'm also interested in any opinion because I want to consider everything and make the best decision. If anyone is in the same boat as me and will be hired with a start date June/July and wants to consider rooming up on a 2 br loft or a nice place, let me know.

In terms of working at Boeing, what can I do from the start of working, or even now that I'm doing the next 12 tasks to make the most of it? I read somewhere, I think here or somewhere else, that even how you deal with emails can help a lot in terms of dealing with organization. What can I do in terms of using their educational programs, financial well being programs, or leadership training programs to help facilitate proper growth within the company? 

Again, I want to thank everyone here from the bottom of my soon to be semi-well paid heart for everything that everyone does in this subreddit. I will be sure to answer any questions that people might have in applying, networking, or just general concerns in applying.

*Experience with C# and/or Java development
*Working in an Agile environment
*Database experience
*Web Services
*Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)
*Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
*Team Foundation Server (TFS)

Did someone decide the job could be performed by a lower level engineer, or maybe a funding issue?  Regardless, I am still under consideration, so I'll ride it out and see what happens.

,"Hey, there!

&amp;#x200B;

**I have a few questions that I'll list bullet-form here at the top so you can just easily and quickly answer them**.

1. How much do Assembler Installer General B's (or similar) net on average per paycheck after overtime and all that? (I know I'll be making $15.75/hour, but I keep being told I'll make much more on average b/c of overtime.)
2. How would someone earn their degree while working 40-50-hours/week at a position like this?
3. How long would it take someone to move from an assembler installer position (or similar) to a business job?
4. How hard is it/is it possible to get rehired after leaving Boeing after only working a couple months?

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's some background for those wondering why I've asked these questions** and also to provide some framework in answering them, to those especially helpful/insightful people:

I'm about to start a new job with Boeing at the Everett Paine Field facility as an ""Assembler Installer General B"" starting tomorrow 02/15/19 at $15.75/hour. I coincidentally just got another job offer from a local ER working as a medic starting at about $30/hour and only working 3 days/week (long days though, mind you). My long-term goal is to change from the medical field ASAP into the business world, and I had *so* many people recommend Boeing to me to be the place to get a paid-for bachelor's in business degree (I already have an associates degree), and then easily transfer to a business-related job (as opposed to being an outsider with zero experience but also having completed a bachelor's degree in business). I've been assured that ""getting \[my\] foot in the door"" with any position I can get is a smart idea for someone with my goals of obtaining a degree and moving into a higher-paying business job, but this other job offer that pays almost twice the hourly rate, and is only a 3-day work week has me reconsidering if \~$15/hour at Boeing is the best move for me, especially considering I'm a husband and father and would like to see my family on occasion. However, if I'll actually be making something like $40k/year as an assembler, and I end up being able to change to a business job in less than a year, then I think it's worth it.

,"Good day,

I am a non-union, non-engineering professional in my mid-20s, started a position at BDS late last year at a rather smaller site. 

Prior to my current position at Boeing, I worked for an innovative, fast-paced manufacturing company where I was constantly challenged and was able to keep myself busy in a good way. I had coworkers that I got along great with, and would say I had a pretty good social life at work as well. So far, two things have really stuck out to me in my new position at Boeing.

* Amount of downtime - I typically finish all of my required tasks in less than quarter of the workday, and the remaining amount of time I either act like I'm working, work on personal development stuff (coding/analytics courses etc...), or just plain dicking around
   * I've spoken to my manager a few times about this, and the response he has given me has always been along the lines of ""The xxx program will pick up soon  (undefined period of time) so you'll have plenty to do"", ""Try to learn more about the business/process in your downtime"" etc...
* Can't/don't get along with my coworkers - all of my coworkers are at least 10 years older than I am and have been with the company for 10+ years with a family and we have absolutely nothing but work in common
   * I realize that I'm not coming to work to socialize, but not having anyone to be able to talk about my hobbies or just my daily life makes my day go a lot slower and painful. I also don't have a whole lot of friends in my personal life too so this just makes me feel even shittier

This has been a huge culture shock for me, and I feel like Boeing is not for me and am wasting my time here. But my other dilemma is that I don't want to leave the company with just a few months under my belt and hurt my resume unless I really, really have to. I just wanted to see if anybody could relate with me to any of the things I've come across above in my short time with the company so far, and if so, how did you deal with it?

,"Just tried contacting Boeing via their website's ""careers feedback"" form, but it won't seem to submit.  Tried the phone number, but it just puts me in an automated loop.  So now I'm coming here for help.

I want to find out if Boeing would offer any assistance with selling our house as part of their relocation assistance program.  I want to start applying for engineering jobs, but my wife and I own a house in the midwest.  We would need to relocate if I get a job offer, which means finding an apartment wherever the job is.  Problem is, there's no way we could afford an apartment in the Seattle area AND our mortgage at the same time, and I'd hate to be stuck in a situation where I accept a job offer, relocate, and then the house doesn't sell.  Lots of jobs say they offer ""relocation assistance,"" but I can't find anywhere on the website that gives details on what all that assistance can include.  So at the moment I'm hesitating on applying for any jobs.

Does anyone know if Boeing might offer any assistance with selling our home?  Or, does anyone know who I can contact at Boeing to get more information about their relocation assistance?

,"My question is in regards to getting reassigned to a different program...I went through orientation on Friday, was very excited to be there. Was chatting with everyone about the planes and how stoked I was to be working on the new 777X. I had heard from an employee that I have connections with that they were hiring like mad for the new program. Fast forward to the part of the day where we see our training schedule...and I'm one of two people assigned to the 747/767 program. My heart sank, I am very good at finding creative solutions to problems and was hoping to being able to shine on a new plane.

How is negotiation? I was hoping to get a 10-20% increase (reasons being: I am overqualified for entry level since I have been working in the field for two years while completing my degree in CS, graduated with a high GPA, washington is extremely far from home and from my research it is not as desirable as other states I have offers from, etc).

My other offers are not higher than the current offer from Boeing but that is because the cost of living is much cheaper in the cities I got offers from (all of which are fortune 500).

Were you able to negotiate an increase this large?

I have a few questions for those of you who have gone and are currently going through the Boeing hiring process. I am a senior graduating in June 2019. I've been actively applying to Boeing in Washington since September for entry level methods process analyst, manufacturing engineer, and industrial engineer positions. So far none of my 15+ submissions have successfully turned into interviews but none of them have been changed to ""no longer under consideration."" I did however apply to a job that I was definitely under qualified for to test the ATS  and did get an update for ""no longer under consideration"". If it adds any value, all of the positions still have their withdraw button present. 

I'm starting to get a little anxious and worried. I've been trying to keep my hopes up as I applied to Northrop Grumman last year during September and was finally called, interviewed, and given an offer in January. I'm hoping that Boeing is somewhat similar in this regard.

Is it normal for these applications to take upwards of 3 months to turn into interviews? If anybody has information that can help me better identify the position that I'm in, it would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

I have a quasi-co-worker (he‚Äôs in the same dept, but currently on a different shift) - lets call him ‚ÄúBlingy‚Äù - who many of my teammates would like to see fired.

Petty, you say?

Perhaps a little - he‚Äôs not well liked for his arrogant &amp; entitled attitude, but it‚Äôs mainly his getting away with some big no no‚Äôs. Such as:

- regularly smoking pot. Blingy has outright refused to do certain tasks because they could potentially result in damage to production parts, which would require a drug test... which he has said he would fail because of his pot usage. However, apparently because two managers need to hear this, it‚Äôs somehow not actionable(?!?!) He‚Äôs been witnessed consuming in the parking lot as well. I‚Äôve been close enough to smell it on him a few times.

- regularly avoiding work for *hours at a time.* He's been CAM‚Äôd for this, but still does it. He‚Äôs infamous for doing it, in fact. It‚Äôs been said he‚Äôs lazy, but I disagree: Blingy puts significant effort into *NOT* working.

- the latest thing: not knowing how to use specialized tools that he‚Äôs assigned to. He‚Äôs supposed to be in charge of a particular machine, and has been very territorial about other people using it. But since he‚Äôs on another shift, myself &amp; some others went to do some work on this machine &amp; discovered it was not calibrated properly (it was off by *hundredths* of an inch; tolerance is *hundred thousandths*) It‚Äôs been well known for a while that work produced by Blingy is substandard, and at least one engineer refuses to assign work to him at all because of this. Blingy was either unaware, and/or didn‚Äôt care that his machine was grossly out of tolerance. 

- oh, and as soon as he realized other people were ‚Äúmessing‚Äù with ‚Äúhis‚Äù machine, he locked up what accessories he could and tried to make the machine unusable. He failed because several of us on our shift know quite a bit more about it than he does.

There‚Äôs plenty more, much of it documented. This is a shaving off the tip of the iceberg.

I‚Äôm proud of this company &amp; what we do, and it bothers me that someone with such a terrible work ethic hasn‚Äôt been punished.

Anyway, advice on how to bring any relevant info to HR would be helpful.

From what I've heard, you need to stay at the initial union position for a year before you are allowed to transfer. What sort of departments/roles could I be trained into during that 1 year window? I have two years of previous work experience as a lab technician and doing some basic environmental testing. Are there any air quality/environmental regulation positions that I could slide into (would these still qualify for transfer under the union)?  Or perhaps there are other laboratory/testing jobs might fit those requirements? I'm also quite good with data/computers but that's a little farther away from my degree.

Any advice on future opportunities at Boeing would be appreciated. ",/r/boeing/comments/a28hie/opportunities_for_wire_assembler_with/,198,1141
,"Hi guys,

I had a phone interview for the Software Engineer position (Boeing Defense in Charleston, SC) almost 4 weeks ago. For some reason, the hiring manager directly called me to schedule that phone interview. I asked the interviewer when I could expect to hear back from them after the interview and he said should be within 2 weeks. 

I have not heard anything yet and my Taleo status has not changed after the interview. The status of my application still shows ‚ÄòUNDER CONSIDERATION‚Äô. 

I tried to contact the hiring manager by e-mail but no response. In addition, there is no recruiter in between us whom I can contact. 

Is this normal to get a call directly from the hiring manager to schedule the interview? Just wondering if I should keep expecting to hear back from them.

I just wanted to get general opinions about this opportunity from fellow Boeing employees, preferably some firsthand experience in the Puget Sound region.

I hope this is okay to discuss about in here. I have been applying to Boeing positions for a few years now and have been having some success through networking.

,"I've posted about this here before and have taken all of the things I've heard into account while looking over the past several months, but I wanted to post again with some more information to hopefully get a more solid range of ideas.  

Background: I'm moving from Atlanta to work at the Everett site (the 40-88 building specifically) sometime next January, and I'll have just graduated with my AE degree as well. With the exception of two friends in my class who also got the same offer, I don't know anyone who lives in the Seattle area, nor have I ever visited the city. I've heard amazing things about the Seattle area though and as a cycling enthusiast I'm really hyped about making the move.  
I'm trying to figure out what part of town to live in initially as I arrive. The difficult part seems to be balancing the commute time versus the benefits of living closer to Seattle. On the one hand, it would be amazing if I had the ability to bike to work every morning and lived close enough to do so (there are ways to do that, right?), but on the other hand I don't want to live far away from Seattle and miss out on the social opportunities. Plus I've heard that there are certain areas of Everett you should avoid. Moving closer to Seattle means rent goes up and so does the commute time, but I just wanted to see and get some advice on if the benefits of living closer outweighed those costs, especially as a single guy who will have (next to) no friends.

Today, one of the managers called and said they want to extend an offer for the same position as a level 1 instead of level 2 engineer. I just have to reapply to a new requisition.

But as I fill out the job application, I'm a little concerned about the voluntary disclosure for disability survey the application window makes everyone fill out. I technically had a disability, but it doesn't affect my ability to be an engineer now in anyway. 

I've done some research and get conflicting opinions on how to fill out the survey. Some say it's best to lie and say I don't have a disability, but others say that I should because of ""affirmative action policies"" or ""quotas"", as they put it. Others say I could put down, ""choose not to disclose"", but this sort of suggests I have something to hide. 

I don't want to lie on the survey application, especially because I want to work as an engineer in the defense industry. But I'd like to know if answering ""I do have a disability"" would affect my chances of landing an interview or possibly a job offer.

,"I‚Äôm new to the company, so if this is frowned upon in any way, I‚Äôll gladly remove this thread. 

I just want to honestly offer a few options to those that are relocating to the OKC area, or are interning at this site. 

We recently had a late summer intern that used Craigslist to find housing, which he paid $500 a month for a bedroom, living in someone‚Äôs home. Apparently, this wasn‚Äôt a pleasant experience for the intern as it was all ‚Äúsite unseen‚Äù and the ‚Äúlandlord‚Äù was very rude the whole stay. We also just had a few new hires from out of state and one in particular told me his/her housing situation and they‚Äôre paying about $200 more than market value for a one bed/one bath apartment for the next year. That‚Äôs ridiculous. A company took someone with no knowledge of the area and is essentially over charging them for a place to live. I‚Äôll add that this new hire is fresh out of college and will be struggling to make ends meet because of what they‚Äôre paying in rent. 

Shamelessly adding now; my wife is a property manager for a company that owns/operates multiple complexes/townhomes throughout the OKC metro area. You‚Äôd have your choice to live as far north as Edmond, or as far south as Norman. The site is located near Tinker AFB in Midwest City. You can PM me if you‚Äôd like and I‚Äôd gladly give you contact information to the management company so you can view where you‚Äôre moving to and negotiate pricing. 

*That‚Äôs the one thing I‚Äôd like for you to take away from this, don‚Äôt be afraid to negotiate your deposit/security/rent. People don‚Äôt seem to know that that‚Äôs something that one can do. Ask about discounts and ask about monthly specials, every property has them, and every property uses them to ensure someone will lease with them.*

Anyways, I hope this helps someone in the future, even if you don‚Äôt contact me just know that you can negotiate these things. They need your money just as much as you need a place to stay.

Looking at my completed background report, it says Discrepancy next to that employment check, but it doesn't tell me what the discrepancy is.

Under ""Information Verified"" it says that HireRight verified the internship dates (to the day, whereas I only put in the months and year), verified a different intern title (e.g. I put in ""Manufacturing Intern"", but they verified ""Intern II""), and the company name that they verified doesn't contain ""Inc."" at the end, which I said it did.

But here's the kicker. For a previous internship, I said I worked it during the summer of 2016 (which is true), but under ""Information Verified"" it says my dates of employment were July-Dec of 2016. Yet there is no discrepancy.

I was recently contacted by Boeing (specifically Boeing Intelligence &amp; Analytics), and they are interested in my application and would like to interview.

My interpretation is that, by signing this, I am immediately giving up all job security or benefit security with Boeing. I've pasted the entire document below.

I hereby give the Company permission   to contact schools, previous employers (unless otherwise indicated),   references, and others, and hereby release the Company from any liability as   a result of such contract.

I also understand that (1) the Company may   institute a drug and alcohol policy that provides for pre-employment testing   as well as testing after employment, (2) consent to and compliance with such   a policy is a condition of my employment; and (3) continued employment is   based on the successful passing of testing under such policy.  I further   understand that continued employment may be based on successful passing of   job-related physical examinations (if applicable). 

I understand that, in connection with the   routine processing of your employment application, the Company may request   from a consumer reporting agency an investigative consumer report including   information as to my credit records, character, general reputation, personal   characteristics, and mode of living.

Although I haven't taken it yet, I'm shooting for around a 1500 on the SAT. My main extracurriculars are eagle scout, class president, cross country captain, and volunteering at the local children's clinic. 

But a major concern I have is my lack of involvement in explicit STEM or aviation related activities. Don't get me wrong, I spend hours upon hours of my free time reading and researching aviation related stuff, but it's nothing that I can put on a college application. How should I be getting involved in the aviation field as a highschooler? Are there aviation or research internships for highschoolers? Would a local airport hire me for anything (I live in JAX so there's a good bit of aviation in my town). The passion is there, I just don't know how exactly to apply it. 

Lastly, where should I apply to college? I'm aware that Boeing looks upon certain schools very highly, so naturally I would like to attend one of those universities. Which schools does Boeing favor for their engineers? As for getting in, I probably won't get into a top tier school like MIT, but I think I have a chance at the top 50 level. My in state school is University of Florida, which actually has a decent aeronautical engineering program. Any advice on where to apply?

June 26th - Completed Task List
June 28th - Completed drug testing, started background

So, what are these **EVENTS** and is there anyway to prep for them? I've been burned by technical interviews more times than I can count with Amazon/Google etc.... I've heard over and over online how it's mostly just STAR behavior questions, but I also don't want to be blindsided either.

* Has anyone successfully negotiated 7-10% or so on an offer they were given? I'm not super unhappy with the number, but would have liked to see it a bit higher, and believe I have the skills/experience to back this up.

* The vacation policy seems quite decent (10 days starting, most federal holidays, some days off for Christmas?), but would it would it be unreasonable to ask for 2-3 days more, or is this something that is really set in stone for new hires? I would like for them to match the vacation package that I currently have from my employer, but don't want to risk my offer by doing so...

* Does Boeing usually give out end of year performance based bonuses, separate from salary increases that may take place during a review?

,"When most people hear the term welding, they think of metals being fused together, creating sparks similar to those produced by a 4th of July sparkler.

,"Using a throwaway for OPSEC reasons.

Hello, everyone. I wanted to know everybody's experience in dealing with interns who submitted for intern to intern conversion for the following summer, and possible advice on my next course of action.

Quick backstory, I accepted and completed a summer internship last year with the Boeing Company as an engineer intern. The thing with our entire team was that due to a ""certain regional activity"" (don't want to say any more) taking place at the time, all interns in my business unit were told, prior to the start of the internship, we would most likely not be invited back or offered FT positions with that business unit, and encouraged to start networking with the other business partners within Boeing (BCA, BDS, BGS etc)

I was given a positive review at the end, and was even given several weeks of extension after finishing my initial 3 months with offer of recommendation letter from several managers and the director. So I don't think I did too bad, as this was my first internship.

So my problem is, I submitted my application for the intern to intern conversion but have not received any word yet. I reached out to a two managers in a different business unit that I networked with during last summer but they don't seem all too reliable; offered to help but goes silent when I send a followup mail. The last I heard from one of the manager is a forwarded e-mail where he asked an HR rep on opening a req for an intern position (this was over a month ago with no response), and the other manager telling me they are opening req for interns soon and will ""keep me posted"". So far, most managers are probably busy and typically do not keep me posted until I send a followup e-mail usually in 1-2 week interval.

What is the typical rate that interns are reinvited back for another internship? Do hiring team review applications from the intern conversion before checking through career fair/individual submissions?

,"As a person who has been working in Boeing for 5 years and counting, I have a question about promotion.

I noticed that recently, the odd of promotion is becoming more difficult. The reason for this is Boeing wants engineers to rotate around various roles and be average at all of those.

In other words, when there is a new airplane program, the job positions open but filled by people with somewhat different expertise. For example, people who have been working on fuselage structure, who has enough experience to maybe get promoted, had to transfer to systems structure. The cause might be the current program he/she was in was downsizing and had to offload head count to that different org.

If this happens, suddenly, a person with almost enough experience to be promoted, is effectively now a person who know nothing about systems structure.

It is fair to say that, there are common skill-set for both programs. Thus, the person can still perform what is required as an structure engineer. However, that person is now not as confident and no more a subject matter expert anymore. That person has to rely on leads for help and have to reclaim that experience to be considered for promotion.

After a while, now that person needs to move again to different position, perhaps like Liasion Engineer, because the program has finished and have to offload people.

I see this commonly and have personally experienced it. I have worked in a fatigue/damage tolerance group and then transferred to fuselage production support to now, systems stress. Yes, I now have varied experience but have no real depth.

I see that there are few coworkers who share the same sentiment. I know a person who has 15 years of experience and have just been floating around the company doing level 2/3 work the whole time. If he was able to stick to one group, he might have become level 4 by now.

So far from what I‚Äôve noticed on Glassdoor as well as Boeing careers, there are less entry level job postings for the Puget Sound area compared to lower COL areas like St. Louis, Oklahoma City, Charleston etc. which is confusing given that the Puget Sound region is Boeing‚Äôs biggest site by far in terms of overall employment and sheer size. 

I know a lot of the interns go into the ITCFP rotational program and a lot of entry level jobs are filled internally before they‚Äôre even posted outside externally so this could partially be the reason why, but I also read online that Boeing has been actively trying to downsize and move high paying IT jobs from higher COL areas like Seattle/LA to lower COL areas.

,"Hello all,

I may be beating a dead horse here to some extent, but I figured I'd ask: I applied for a job with Boeing Defense here in the Seattle area a while back. I interviewed over the phone about three weeks ago, and the interview went pretty well I think. The job I'm a candidate for is kind of a niche position, there aren't a ton of people who know how do it (especially locally), so I feel like I should have a decent chance. I currently work for one of Boeing's largest competitors in the defense market, already have the clearance, etc. 

I was told by one of the managers after my interview that I should hear back within one to two weeks; it's been three weeks now. I see no activity on my taleo application since before my interview. Is all lost, or is there still a possibility that I'll get an offer? I'd really like the position so I'm kind of anxious. I've been in the defense industry for a bit, and Boeing's hiring process seems foreign to me so I'm psyching myself out a little.

I'm hoping someone from inside Boeing might be able to answer this. I am looking at internships for Aerospace Engineering, and Boeing has always been a great interest of mine. I keep hearing about layoffs in the company, especially in commercial aircraft which is what I was most interested in. Should I avoid Boeing because I could get a job and then be part of a budget cut? (Of course, if I don't do good work then I shouldn't expect to stay). But I don't want to start somewhere just to be laid off a few years later. I am currently looking at a structures engineering position, but am interested in many areas, especially those with greater job security.

,"I'm excited for my first Boeing internship this summer.

1. I'm a Junior. How often do interns get to come back the following year for a 2nd internship?

2. How often do interns secure full time positions? Does the internship REALLY REALLY improve your chances or is it just another resume bullet?

3. Do most interns that DO get hired full time work in the field they interned in or do they just apply to many jobs and hope the internship gets their foot in the door?

I really really want to work at Boeing when I graduate for decades to come, so I'm just trying to gauge if I can already expect to based on securing an internship or if I still have a ways to go to that dream.

For what it's worth, I'm a veteran with a security clearance and have worked as a web developer, so I do feel I have a few other things going for me at least on my resume.",/r/boeing/comments/5owalz/how_often_does_internship_full_time_happen_2nd/,167,852

I never heard anything back, but I'm not too surprised because I am sure that they are very busy. Online on my job page it says that I am still under consideration.

Just a warning- I don't know how jobs work at Boeing, so please forgive me for not use abbreviations or anything.

So I'm a High School freshman in the Puget Sound area (Seattle) and am looking to possibly get a job at Boeing in the future (after college). I would want to get a job as an engineer (probably structural) so that I could actually take part indesigning the wings, fuselage, etc. of the plane. I know that I would have to probably get promoted to that position, and that it's probably very much wanted, but how would you suggest I shape my HS and college career to eventually meet that goal? Also, I might want to work at Microsoft or another big tech company so it'd be great to get a college degree in something that would work for Boeing and tech companies.

,"Hello I‚Äôm currently looking into 2 position that Boeing has available but I have some questions about both. Both are entry level positions and are in the subdivision Strategic Missile Defense Systems of the Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS) division. One of them would be as a systems engineering analyst in Huntsville working on GMD project. The other position would be as an electrical engineer for the ICBM Minuteman 3 subsystem in Utah Hill AFB.

So my question pertains to what would be a typical day be like working as an EE on that project and or a systems engineer analyst as the other? Anyone that has experience with either or with those locations please let me know what you thought of the atmosphere, culture, etc? Also if I take the systems engineering analyst position would it hinder me in getting back to an EE position in the future?

Something I‚Äôm nervous about is that my degree is in EE and I‚Äôm nervous about seeing if I‚Äôm capable of doing the systems engineering since it wouldn‚Äôt be exactly EE related. The only thing that really has me hesitant about the Sys. Engineering Analyst position is if there‚Äôs a lot of coding involved. I think there wouldn‚Äôt be much/ a lot because they would have needed a software engineer instead. Anyone have any advice about this or experience with doing the changeover from what you studied?

I was wondering if Boeing would ever consider hiring a biomedical engineering major for their entry level engineering jobs in which majors such as MechE, EE, or Computer or Software engineers are typically hired.  As a biomed engineering major, we learn similar principles found in EE, MechE, and Material science engineer but apply them to the human body. It has been my dream to work in aerospace but sadly, I chose the wrong major to do so. If anyone has any help/ tips to help me move forward in applying at Boeing, it would be extremely appreciated.

,"Hello. Any EE working at Boeing could share what your typical day is like? Do you feel like there are something to learn everyday?

I got an entry level EE job offer which was quite exciting to me as Boeing has been my dream company for a long time. But from the interview, I have an impression that there isn't going to be much to learn. It sounded like Boeing as an organization pretty much outsource all the electrical/electronics design works to subcontractors with no in-house design capability. After doing some further researches, my impression seems to be true. For example, Boeing did not have the knowledge to fix the 787 battery fire problem as the entire electrical system design was outsourced to a French company. Boeing's solution was to put the battery inside a thick case strong enough to withstand the explosion and eject the hot gas outside. None of the avionic systems on the jet was developed by Boeing, as what used to be the Boeing Commercial Electronics was sold to BAE Systems... In short, should I look elsewhere?

My question is HOW CAN I GET NOTICED. I've done the key words with about 6 different resumes, i've started saying I have schooling just because my experience should count for something in these ""entry jobs"" that seem to all require 4 years of schooling. I've heard about a damn ex prostitute that recently got hired there and owns up to not knowing a damn thing or caring... what am I doing wrong...

Feel free to give any words of wisdom... I just dont know how many more resumes I should customize to key words when it seems to do nothing..

,"
Hello, how are you? I would like to know your advice on something which I cannot decide no matter how hard I think about it. Im 19 years old and Im in my first university year in Physics. I live in Argentina, where there is no division between college and school. You choose a career and you get the m.s after 6 years in the same place you started. I still cant decide even if Im on my first year as they are almost the same classes between the two the first years. I want to choose something that might have an impact on the world. Help the world become better and more advanced.


I like Physics because I am the kind of person which questions everything, not only about Physics but about everything about life. If it were for me I would study physics, engineering, biology and computer science. Also, I would like to, in the future, being useful to humanities technological and scientifical development. And physics seems like a good choice as it basically covers every aspect of the Universe. But, I am also really concerned on the practical aspect of it. I want to help our world become a better place. Help Develop to become a better civilization. Physics might not be the best choice as it is soo abstract I don't think its applications, modern physics, would help much. I was planning on maybe do applied physics as a Phd or engineering as a second career (Really choosing a life path so early is hard!)


Engineering was always my second choice, but right now I am leaning towards it. As I find It will give me better tools and more freedom to accomplish my goals. Also it would be less theorethical with more applications. I was thinking Mechanical Engineering maybe. working in Aerospace is one of my dreams. What would an engineering degree allow me to do there? And what would a Physics degree differentiate in?

,"I got an offer for an engineering position at Boeing in Everett. The offer is very fair and coming from halfway across the country the relocation package is great, move totally paid for. The one hang up I have is still part of that relocation package. My offer does not include a sign on bonus, which a different offer I have here locally does. I didn't think I'd be worried about that, but after reading the /r/Seattle moving to Seattle megathread I'm not sure how I will be able to cover the cost of moving into a new place. Most landlords want security + first and last months rent. My wife and I want to find a 2 bedroom home, and while my salary will allow for the cost of rent we won't really have the income leading up to the move to save for the high initial cost of moving into a space in the area (Boeing completely covers the move, so getting there is fine, its just the initial cost of renting). Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Is there a right way to ask HR about possible assistance in the form of a signing bonus?

After some digging around, it seems Boeing has a shorter interview process than other engineering companies, even to the point where people get an offer after a single phone interview.

I am wondering if anyone who has been on either side of the interview process has any insights as to how long I should expect this process to take and if it is possible to get a job offer after only phone interview/s.

I am asking because I am interviewing in person at another company in 2 weeks and ideally would like to have a choice between offers, not have to choose one over the other because of timing. (If I even have offers given to me)

,"Hi!

I've just come off a Qatar Airways flight in a 787. Wonderful beast. I was mesmerised by the wing the whole flight, and stunned by the carbon fibre thrust reversers. If you get a chance to fly slightly in front of the wing, take a look down at the reactor on landing, because that carbon fibre lattice is absolutely amazing! (Didn't get a chance to picture it and couldn't find a picture online :( )

Now, having stared at the wing for the better part of the flight, I eventually noticed [something dodgy](http://i.imgur.com/P04utJr.jpg) on the reactor. Notice above the fin, there is a bit of lining sticking up. This flattened out on slowing down, and flattened back out completely once landed. But I'm pretty sure this isn't by aerodynamic design, nor by negligence from QR. This is obviously not a structural piece, but I am no Aero Engineer, simply a CS student :3

Apologies if this isn't the right place, I don't think Boeing have planned a real ""Please notify us if the plane starts falling apart"" page on their website, and I can't find aviation enthusiast subreddits... I am hoping some guy can explain what the piece is and what it is actually for, and maybe some Boeing engineer to see it as well.",/r/boeing/comments/3d04wm/reactor_issue/,216,1214

,"Hi,

First. Just some background on me. I am attending a top 10 STEM school in the US on the West Coast. I am majoring in Political Science, with major coursework in Business and Economics. I love working hard and playing hard. I networked to a finance internship with my university as a sophomore, I then had an internship with a top (if not the biggest) Private Wealth Management firm. Currently I am interning 40 hours a week (unpaid) with a boutique investment bank while doing a full course load at school as well as being involved on campus. This summer, I will be interning with Boeing as an ""estimating and pricing"" intern analyst; I do not know yet if it will be with BDS or BCA.

Since I am a junior, I will most likely get a return offer after this summer. I am interested in working for Boeing for various reasons, but I do not know what the career progression is. My other option is to use my Investment Banking internship and Boeing to interview with Investment Banks (bulge brackets and middle markets) this coming Fall quarter.

Now...I am trying to determine what the career progression at Boeing is like. From what I gathered talking to the Boeing employees, everyone works 40 hours a week and that's that; maybe some overtime, but not past 50. I am a type A personality; while I am young, I want to work as much hours as possible, learn as much, climb up the ladder as high as possible. Is Boeing a place for me to do this? I would like to work for Boeing for multiple reasons: cost of living in Seattle/OKC/St.Louis is cheaper than NYC/SF/Chicago, they pay for your MBA/JD.

,"Hi guys hopefully someone here may know what I should do....

I was at a big Boeing hiring event this week myself and 200+ offers were given out offers all at once. So I was able to hear many of the salaries that were being given to students who attended. 

Everyone there was an engineer and from a top 20ish school.  (I was #10ish school). 

Salaries for **undergraduates were ranging from 70K-76K** depending on location.

I am a **Master's Student** (Electrical and computer engineering) with **3 years** of work experience at a large semiconductor company. And got a **79.5K offer**.... (For the very expensive to live in **South California sites**)

I think they may have missed my work experience when building my offer but a **3K** bump for being a Master's student in Electrical and Computer Engineering is pretty crappy. And almost insulting really...

I was seriously considering Boeing for their cool work and even willing to take a pay cut to join them. But I can get 85K in my current city any day of the week... And easily get 95K with a couple extra interviews. (My city also has a 30% cost of living less than the Huntington beach site)

At this point I am not sure what I should do with Boeing. 

**Is this offer consistent with things you have seen in the past?**

**If not how much have you folks seen Master's come in with?**

**Should I press them to revaluate the offer?**

**Should I let them know that this offer is very low for the orange county area?**

**Should I tell them that this offer is very similar to Undergraduate offers that they are giving out?**

**Would It be better for me to express my concerns to HR or the hiring manager?**

I am not sure how they expect me to be a **loyal** employee with a salary like this once I have any amount of training I will be leaving to another posting that is ~100K from one of the many Californian companies...

* I am trying to figure out ***the best Boeing location that will allow me to do AI/Hardware/robotics work now and in the future.***

* (Also if you know what pay is like for a master's student with a 3.8/4.0 from a top 10 school (UT Austin) straight out of college that would help me greatly too!!!, I know this probably depends on the sight but any indicators would be nice.) 

* Also any help / advice for a new employee I would love to hear. (Even if the advice is negative! The more I know the better. Feel free to vent :) )

* This was crossposted with /r/seattle 

* THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO ANSWER THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL FOR ME AND YOUR HELP IS INVALUABLE!!! I will find you when I get hired and buy you a drink :)",/r/boeing/comments/2kg35w/help_how_is_working_at_boeing_seattle_versus/,208,1090

,"Hi, guys;

I'm new to this subreddit. Am loving it so far! I was hoping you might be able to help me answer a couple questions I've always wondered about:

* What's next after the 787? The 797?
* What do you think will happen when Boeing runs out of 7x7 nomenclature? I know they once developed a supersonic airplane and called it the 2707, so I could see them pursuing something like that.
* I know different Boeing jets have different purposes (e.g. the 737 is for short flights, the 747 is used for long flights) and some of the jets no longer are sold (e.g. 707, 727). But what are the differences between the 747, 757, 767, 777, and now 787 (in terms of what they're used for)?
* I saw a documentary on the Discovery Channel recently about the 747, and it said the 747-8 could go within like 12mph of the speed of sound (Wikipedia says max suggested operating speed is Mach 0.90). Is it possible/feasible that some future variant of the 747 (or another Boeing passenger jet) could exceed the speed of sound routinely? Aircraft technology has come a long way since the Concorde/2707/Tu-144 were designed, so I could potentially see it being possible (although as to whether it would be practical is another matter).

Thanks, guys!

I'm curious as to what some actual job titles are for Boeing employees that utilize control theory. I don't know anyone that works for Boeing or I would just ask them :/

As for why I am asking; I recently graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering and discovered controls in my last year. Having not actually enjoyed most of my mechanical engineering courses, my experience with controls has inspired me to pursue a career in that field. So if any of you are employees I would love to know what a good entry level job would be for me to get so that pursue this passion.

Also, I realize that you can search Boeing's website for job openings and see the job titles but I haven't had any real luck finding anything substantial. That's why I'm hoping for an insider opinion.",/r/boeing/comments/25uef3/controls_engineering_at_boeing/,144,794

,"I'm interested in getting into a tech career, and I'm searching for the ""entry level"". My wife and I are considering moving from the midwest to Charleston, SC. Boeing has locations near us (St. Louis) and in Charleston. Its size, industry, and locations make it seem like a solid place to work.

I have a BA in political science, an AAS in radiologic technology, years of experience in diagnostic imaging, and past experience in newspaper journalism. I am in the process of teaching myself some aspects of programming, like Javascript, Python, .NET, etc., but I have nothing exactly relevant to put on a tech resume in terms of experience or education.

The question is, is there any level at Boeing that I would fit into? I'm looking for training at a very entry level, so that I can eventually learn and work my way up to a decent career and title, but I have to start somewhere. Is there a ""somewhere"" at Boeing?

There are different ways we can all contribute!

* Please post as often as you can! Don't worry about over-posting, we need content right now. 

* Please comment and engage in discussions! 

* Please subscribe! This way, you can see posts even if they only have a couple of up-votes (due to a lack of traffic). Don't worry, your ""front-page"" won't get clogged with stuff from here; reddit's code prvents that.

And there's not a situation in which they would absolutely have to do so either. If you're launching satellites to orbit the window is pretty flexible, why launch 2 at the same time when you can have 2 launches within a few days? There's also not a situation in which they would have to launch more than 4 astronauts to the ISS at the same time, hypothetically if they needed to put 4+ astronauts to the ISS the crew dragon is capable of up to 7, the ISS has a capacity of 6.

Article specifically references an Elon tweet dated May 30 2019   question was asked 

""Ah, so single-stage point-to-point? That sounds way better""

Elon Response:

""Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20.""

Also in some of his more recent tweets ( couldn't find quickly at the moment)  Elon has discussed special SS variants for E2E  with more engines to improve TWR and lower gravity losses for sub orbital E2E flights.

Edit:
 
Further down in same teslarati article:

Q: ""I guess the whole SSTO idea doesn't work because of lift off thrust. Raptor is powerful, but with a full propellant load Starship has a TWR under 1. It would need two more engines to have any shot at it.

Starship thrust is appropriately scaled for what it's supposed to do.""

Naturally. While there is mostly SpaceX with low offers, the trend is still that all the expensive launches go to ULA. They got a whole bunch of very expensive Delta IV Heavy launches which SpaceX FH could have done  for a fraction of the cost. Reason being that if ULA does not get those contracts they close the production line for Delta.

My impression is still, SpaceX gets all the praise, ULA gets all the juicy contracts. Until this changes launch prices on average remain high. We will see if SpaceX gets the 60% contract which they should get. They are the only ones who have a certified launch fleet and they are cheaper.

It happens regularly from thoughtless happenstance destruction. To say it is unlikely that humans can make a species extinct without deliberate action is showing your ignorance here.

If an ecosystem is already very strong and healthy it can take the loss of species in stride. The problem is we've massively degraded the ecosystems surrounding us for decades and centuries. When an ecosystem is already on the brink the loss of one vital species can have cascading effects.

,"The re-entry burn always uses three engines, so does the boost back burn. However during these two burns, they ignite the centre engine first to stabilise the rocket, and then ignite two other engines, which due to the increased acceleration, reduces gravity losses. At the end of the burn the two outer engines shut down, and the centre engine ceeps running for a bit. This allows the trajectory to be fine tuned, and the orientation of the vehicle to be corrected, in case the outer engines do not shit down at exactly the same time. 
Droneship landings are usually also performed this way. One engine ignites, which ads a lot of control and stability, followed by the ignition of two more engines, which reduces gravity losses. The final landing is performed with only one engine, since it is easier to land with a lower thrust, since there is more time for corrections.
Land landings usually have higher margins (this is also the reason why they can afford the boost back burn), so a three engine landing burn isn't umdone very often.

,"No. It was explained in the broadcast that, for GTO launches, launching at the beginning of the window allows a reset to launch at the very end of the countdown, by emptying the tanks and starting a new load-and-go cycle.

I wrote a post just a day or 2 ago, detailing the burns involved in getting from the surface of the Earth to GTO, and then from GTO to GEO.  It shows that launches to GTO/GEO are about the least sensitive when it comes to the time of launch.

,"The other answers missed some important points, so, ...

1. After separation, Elon has described each fairing half as, ""its own little spacecraft."" It has thrusters, gyros and enough guidance computer power to keep the outer portion of the fairing oriented into the wind, to provide the slight heat shielding needed, to slow the descent, and to prevent the fairing braking up when aerodynamic forces become significant.
2. Once aerodynamic forces become significant, it becomes possible to use the cold gas thrusters to steer the fairing halves toward the recovery ships. Looking at the shape of the fairings, my guess is that the L/D is higher than that of say, a Dragon capsule. My guess is that each fairing can steer 10 or 20 km while high in the atmosphere.
3. As the fairing gets lower, and slower, steering using the cold gas thrusters gradually stops working. At this point, a drogue chute must be deployed, followed by the parafoil. Parafoils are steerable, (by pulling on control strings) but they are so slow that jet stream winds are up to 20 times faster, so a successful catch is at the mercy of these winds, and accurate weather forecasts. Releasing high altitude weather balloons from the catch vessels might be the latest improvement.
4.  At low altitudes, winds are less, so control authority of the parafoil becomes greater. calm breezes and seas increase the odds of a successful catch.",/r/spacex/comments/huv6hu/elonmusk_on_twitter_both_fairing_halves_caught/fyqj684/,238,1406

,"Great explanation!

I am saving that.
Thanks.

Partly this is an engineering problem, partly this is just that the hydrolox exhaust is much, much lighter. This is great from an Isp standpoint because it leads to higher exhaust velocities and higher efficiency. But it's terrible for generating high thrust.

Some examples. Look at the space shuttle main engine (SSME, RS-25). One of the most expensive and advanced engines ever created. A full-flow staged combustion, regeneratively cooled LOX/LH2 engine. Each one generated about 2.3 MegaNewtons of thrust, with a sealevel exhaust velocity of 3.56 km/s, all from a beast of an engine that weighed 3.2 tonnes each. If you do the math, that thrust and exhaust velocity works out to a mass flow rate of 640 kg/s.

Now, compare that to a Merlin 1-D LOX/Kerosene engine. A gas-generator ""open cycle"" engine very similar in design to rocket engines built in the 1960s. Iteratively upgraded a lot to maximize performance, but still fundamentally limited in a few ways (it doesn't use staged combustion, for example). A sealevel exhaust velocity of just 2.75 km/s, just 77% of what the SSME was able to achieve. However, each engine weighs only 490 kg, and can pump out 845 kN of thrust. If you do the math, that's a mass flow rate of 306 kg/s, in an engine about 1/6th the mass of the SSME. With 6 Merlin 1-D's you can produce over twice the thrust of a single SSME for less total engine mass.

Some of this comes back to basic gas laws. Lower molecular weight exhaust leads to higher molecular speeds at equivalent temperatures, but it also leads to lower mass flow at equivalent pressures. But a lot of it comes down to propellant density. Go back to the SSME vs. Merlin 1-D's again. 6x Merlin 1-D's move 1800 liters/s of propellant, while 1x SSME moves 1900 liters/s of propellant, and they have equivalent engine weights, but the 6x Merlin 1-D's produce over twice as much total thrust.

Even if you scale things back to just 3x Merlin 1-D's where you have roughly equivalent rates of LOX usage you end up with the Merlin 1-D's pumping about 320 liters/s or 255 kg/s of Kerosene while the SSME is pumping a whopping 1280 liter/s of hydrogen but that's still only 91 kg/s. And the end result is that the 3x Merlin 1-D's produce more thrust with less than half the total engine mass of the SSME.

With Hydrogen you need big pipes and big turbopumps and that translates to heavier engines for the same thrust.",/r/spacex/comments/hu6sci/rspacex_anasisii_official_launch_discussion/fypvfov/,430,2454

,"Partly this is an engineering problem, partly this is just that the hydrolox exhaust is much, much lighter. This is great from an Isp standpoint because it leads to higher exhaust velocities and higher efficiency. But it's terrible for generating high thrust.

Some examples. Look at the space shuttle main engine (SSME, RS-25). One of the most expensive and advanced engines ever created. A full-flow staged combustion, regeneratively cooled LOX/LH2 engine. Each one generated about 2.3 MegaNewtons of thrust, with a sealevel exhaust velocity of 3.56 km/s, all from a beast of an engine that weighed 3.2 tonnes each. If you do the math, that thrust and exhaust velocity works out to a mass flow rate of 640 kg/s.

Now, compare that to a Merlin 1-D LOX/Kerosene engine. A gas-generator ""open cycle"" engine very similar in design to rocket engines built in the 1960s. Iteratively upgraded a lot to maximize performance, but still fundamentally limited in a few ways (it doesn't use staged combustion, for example). A sealevel exhaust velocity of just 2.75 km/s, just 77% of what the SSME was able to achieve. However, each engine weighs only 490 kg, and can pump out 845 kN of thrust. If you do the math, that's a mass flow rate of 306 kg/s, in an engine about 1/6th the mass of the SSME. With 6 Merlin 1-D's you can produce over twice the thrust of a single SSME for less total engine mass.

Some of this comes back to basic gas laws. Lower molecular weight exhaust leads to higher molecular speeds at equivalent temperatures, but it also leads to lower mass flow at equivalent pressures. But a lot of it comes down to propellant density. Go back to the SSME vs. Merlin 1-D's again. 6x Merlin 1-D's move 1800 liters/s of propellant, while 1x SSME moves 1900 liters/s of propellant, and they have equivalent engine weights, but the 6x Merlin 1-D's produce over twice as much total thrust.

Even if you scale things back to just 3x Merlin 1-D's where you have roughly equivalent rates of LOX usage you end up with the Merlin 1-D's pumping about 320 liters/s or 255 kg/s of Kerosene while the SSME is pumping a whopping 1280 liter/s of hydrogen but that's still only 91 kg/s. And the end result is that the 3x Merlin 1-D's produce more thrust with less than half the total engine mass of the SSME.

With Hydrogen you need big pipes and big turbopumps and that translates to heavier engines for the same thrust.",/r/spacex/comments/hu6sci/rspacex_anasisii_official_launch_discussion/fypt6bd/,423,2407

,"The SpaceX launch pricing allowed them to book lots of launches.  The launch rate allowed them to test (and initially fail) the landing process using boosters that were already paid for by customers.  The launch rate also has allowed them to repeatedly test (and initially fail) the fairing recovery process, again using fairings paid for by customers.   SpaceX has proven that fairing recovery is not easy.  The other launch providers simply do not have a launch rate that justifies the expense and provides the experience needed to be successful at recovery.

Blue Origin is not likely going to have a launch rate that will allow them to repeatedly test these recovery processes.   I'm sure that they have learned a lot by watching SpaceX, but it is going to be scary watching a rocket as massive as New Glenn attempting its first landing on a crewed and moving ship.  I am guessing that they will have to first perform several successful water landings.

,"&gt;Does/Will SpaceX have the operational capacity to handle same-day launches?

Right now spacex does not have the capacity for same day launches but the starship super heavy system including GSE is being designed with this in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What launch sites would be the most feasible for same-day launches? 

None of their existing sites would really be a good fit for multiple same day launches although this is really not a hardware problem but rather a range availability problem. Range control for more frequent launches was one of the original reasons listed for the development of the boca chica site back when it was intended to launch F9 and FH.   For high flight rates  spacex is investigating the use of ""floating launch complexes""  basically large platforms out at sea to launch and land rockets from in a safe environment where noise is much less of a concern.  They have already begun hiring engineers for this initiative.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Will boosters possibly be re-used for same-day launches? 

The intent is that yes the same booster is designed to be fly almost hourly if capacity dictates ( take this with a grain of salt,  F9 block 5 was supposed to be designed to re fly with a 24 hour turn around time and we are still a long way from that).  Note while the booster can RTLS within 15 minutes of launch the upper stage takes several hours due to orbital dynamics so the stated elon goal is that starships can fly up to three times a day ( again take this with a grain of salt)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Would this be the norm for orbital refueling? 

Yes the refueling will likely be the primary driver of higher flight rates early in the life cycle of Starship / Super Heavy.  It may take 7 or more tanker flights to top up a starship so high flight numbers are required.  This will be interesting to see as they will need it for their artemis program ""lunar starship""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; What types of missions would benefit from multiple same-day launches? 

Refueling will definitely benefit from same day launches,  there is also the stated goal of earth to earth flight/transport using only starship,  this will likely start as an ultra high speed intercontinental delivery service and extend to passenger travel once / if sufficient safety levels are attained. This question is also a bit unknown at this point in addition to Refueling missions,  and E2E transport there is a bit of a ""If you build it they will come"" flavor to this system as well.  I don't think there is really a good understanding of what the need will be for a high capacity spaceflight at orders of magnitude below today's cost.   You could see daily or weekly trips to ISS,  you could see an explosion of commercial activity / space tourism.   Who knows what applications the military might have for dropping 150 tonnes of cargo anywhere on earth in 30 minutes flat.  If the system works at intended ( eventually)   it will be very interesting to watch.    Sit back and enjoy the show!",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fypr6cw/,520,3000

,"Maybe I'm thinking of the landing burn. 

Is it 3 for the re-entry burn and only 1 for landing?

The return-to-launch-site landing confused me for a long time because if you go up, then east, then west, then down... the down part is free obviously but you need to spend fuel to slow down and land gently. But to go west again you need to slow down then go back the way you came which sounds like an INSANE waste of fuel... until you remember by this point the rocket has shed almost all of its weight, in particular the second stage and payload plus most of its fuel. 
So a lighter rocket can go west again for a fraction of the fuel.

So is it 1-3-1 to slow to a stop, turn around and head west again, then it's only a single rocket for landing?",/r/spacex/comments/hmlcar/rspacex_discusses_july_2020_70/fypj5s7/,146,746

,"In addition to what /u/eigenlaplace said, the ideal way to process HDR is to stack the images prior to converting them into a [display-referred](http://www.xdcam-user.com/2013/10/understanding-the-difference-between-display-referenced-and-scene-referenced/) format. Then do all the scene-referred edits and the final output conversion on the merged stack as a single image(ideally in floating point to preserve the range).

HDR photography isn't always done this way, sometimes it's manually compositing over several separate images, but that can lose data since you have multiple clip/rolloff points within the image instead of a single unified curve the way a sensor or film stock with sufficient dynamic range would have. Stacking prior to the output conversion preserves this workflow (Lightroom's built-in HDR features works this way, which is why it acts like a raw from a higher d-range sensor instead of the weirder HDR workflows you can end up with in other software)

EDIT: also, the SpaceX image is likely a stack of 2 totally different images, you can see the gradient above the top of the lightning tower where the overspill from the pad lights appears brighter in the sky than it does next to the rocket.",/r/spacex/comments/hupg2d/comet_neowise_over_falcon_9_and_anasisii_vertical/fyphxhc/,187,1218

,"First stage: 287.5 tonnes of LOX. Second stage: 75 tonnes of LOX.

Thrust is equal to mass flow rate times exhaust velocity. Denser propellants are able to achieve a higher mass flow rate so they generally have higher thrust (though lower exhaust velocities).

You can see this with vehicles like Ariane 5, H-IIA, and the Shuttle, which use LOX/LH2 core stages but have to rely on solid rocket boosters for extra thrust during liftoff. Designing a LOX/LH2 engine with enough thrust to serve as a first stage engine is much more challenging than doing so with a LOX/Kerosene engine. The latter has been done since the 1950s and there are many examples. The former has been done with the Delta IV, which is one of the most expensive launch vehicles in history.",/r/spacex/comments/hu6sci/rspacex_anasisii_official_launch_discussion/fypgmi7/,132,758

,"Environmental concerns of industrial projects are absolutely valid. However, there are other solutions other than ""yes, go for it, damn the consequences"" or ""no, shut it down, save the ecosystem"". I am Canadian, and for a long time we had an environmental policy of ""no net loss"", meaning that an industrial impact that results in a loss to the environment had to be offset by an equal enhancement to the environment (not necessarily in the same place, but as adjacent as possible). We have moved on from that policy to a ""net gain"" policy, ie if an industrial project is going to negatively impact an area's environment, then the company needs to enhance an area that would result in a gain to the overall ecosystem. Examples are artificial reefs, for example, or planting inter-tidal grasses and providing storm barriers so those areas are protected and can provide protection to juvenile fish.

,"I think that with modern modeling and control systems, the issues around plumbing are easier to deal with than they were 50 years ago. FH already flies with 27 engines attached to the same structure, after all.

A 3m x 6.5m long cylinder is ~46m^3. For DragonXL to match that with just the main pressure vessel (so not counting the tunnel through the service module), it only has to be 4.3m long. It's hard to tell from the angle of the [official rendering](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NSF-2020-03-27-18-54-00-196-1170x716.jpg), but that doesn't seem unreasonable. Some fan [rendering/recreation](http://imgur.com/gallery/P9QL4CK) had it much longer than that. 

&gt;And that NASA might‚Äôve been better off requesting a modified variant of Dragon XL

Eh. HALO got sole sourced in the interest of time. Even if SpaceX could have done better, it was NASA's opinion that this was the fastest. It's essentially a suped up node module, like, it was literally previously called the Minimal Habitation Module for a reason. It'll link the crew vehicle (Orion) to their extra supplies and room (DragonXL) and the lander (TBD). I think it's fine, and we're moving forward, and we didn't have to slog through a drawn out bidding process for a minimal node.

,"Well, certainly it increases the amount of fuel you need for your orbit-insertion burn at Mars arrival, due to the extra mass of the still-attached rover.

But you‚Äôre right, the upside is this will reduce the entry velocity of the rover into Mars atmosphere.  Whether they will continue to lower the orbit over the following months after orbit-insertion, to further lower the entry velocity, I don‚Äôt know.

But it‚Äôs been done both ways in the past.  The US Viking missions in the 1970‚Äôs inserted into Mars orbit before deploying the ~~rovers~~ landers.

,"Usually landers will go for direct entry, as entering orbit costs more. However, this does require high accuracy and a good understanding of where you're going. (Viking landers went into orbit because they had no good imagery to choose a landing site; they needed the orbiters to do mapping first!)

If it's an orbiter, it's probably entering a high elliptical orbit and need to lower and circularize for science operations. Sometimes this is done via aerobraking, though I don't know in this case.

So if you have a lander on an orbiter, and have the dV budget to carry it into orbit (and/or don't want to try to separate for a direct entry, either due to guidance or mapping) you might as well carry the lander into a low orbit.

Honestly i'm skeptical about multiple things about it.

(figures might be out of date)
Technically: Falcon 9 (this version) has flown 68 times (wikipedia), 26 of which were reuse. The maximum reflight amount has been 5/6 times I believe. I'm aware that Starship has been designed bottom up to be 100% reusable and is a different beast but to go from this to flying hundreds of reuses on the same rocket with very little refurb if any is a huge challenge.

Lets say the technical challenges can be overcome and its safe enough to fly E2E you then have the enviromental factors, where is it going to fly to/from, airports struggle from noise regulations nevermind a rocket like Starship.

You then have legislation which will probably be the hardest/slowest part. Most rockets are launched off the coast heading over the ocean. You've got to convince goverment/legislatures that no one is going to have rocket debry land on their house (unless your china).

,"NEPA does not prevent a federal agency from doing environmentally reprehensible things (or permitting a licensee to do those things). It requires awareness of the environmental impacts of agency action (or permitted action), not that the most environmentally friendly option be chosen. You could prepare an EIS for burning down a rain forest, document all the parade of horrible, and still decide that the need was there to destroy it; and NEPA would not stop you. At best, the environmentalist would pour through the EIS to find something you overlooked, and file to say ""Well, you didn't consider this part of it"", and seek to pause the action until that part was considered. The effects of choosing a poor environmental outcome are not legal, they're political. 

The Endangered Species Act is different, and requires an agency to refrain from taking adverse impact to a listed species. But even then, there is an exception written in which allows the ""God Squad"" at the Council of Environmental Quality (an Office of the President in the White House) to waive the requirements and essentially allow the species to go extinct, if needed for a national interest.

,"Differential heating across the surface of the ship causing distortion is an interesting issue. During re-entry you'd expect the main tanks to be mostly empty, since any fuel they were carrying at this point should have been used on launch, on orbit or not carried at all.

It's interesting to note that the Raptor engines actually heat fuel in the engine bell and use part of this fuel (prior to combustion) to repressurize the tanks (essentially heating them with combustion energy). See the ""tank pressurant"" pipes in this diagram

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX\_Raptor#/media/File:Raptor\_Engine\_Unofficial\_Combustion\_Scheme.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Raptor#/media/File:Raptor_Engine_Unofficial_Combustion_Scheme.svg)

,"To me the issue looks like heating of the tank walls during reentry. If the heat shield side of the tank gets to 600&amp;deg;C, while the lee side is at \~200&amp;deg;C, the whole frame of the Starship will look like a banana, and heat will be transported by the residual gasses inside the tanks, to the far side, which is good. But heated gas increases in pressure. You don't want the pressure in any tank to get so high that it bursts, You might have to vent residual gas to prevent bursting. You also might have to vent gas from the header tanks, although the thermal inertia of liquid fuel could keep the pressure down, for the minutes between the start of reentry, and the final landing burn.

After landing, as the rocket cools down, you get the opposite problem, which we saw with SN4, I think. If you have vented gas out during reentry to prevent overpressure, then after landing and cooling, he pressure in the tank might get too low, resulting in a crushed tank.

For the LOX tank, you could vent air into them, but for the methane tank, that's not a good idea. You would be making a giant fuel-air bomb. Better to use leftover methane from the methane header tank to adjust the main methane tank pressure.",/r/spacex/comments/hrt56a/starship_sn5_set_for_a_static_fire_followed/fylzj0o/,222,1216

I think it is possible they will fly Starliner as copilots. There are many astronauts, and not many first flights to be had (or space flights of any description, at this time).

,"It's a long time since I talked to Tito, and I don't remember whether he hinted to me that the Russian bureaucrats, who were not sophisticated about economics, had naively underestimated the total cost, or if this was a conclusion I came to, years later. Either way, I agree with you.

On the other hand, NASA and the ""old space,"" US contractors have often ""killed"" commercial space by overcharging. It is far smarter to spread the R&amp;D cost over 1000 launches, than to establish a price so high the R&amp;D costs are covered in 2 or 3 launches.

1)  one or two legs would touch first, in a soft landing (then possibly land hard on the other legs as starship rotates after touchdown) or

2) or all legs will touch simultaneously and it would land with some lateral velocity.  If they rotate at the last second and and hard, then the lateral velocity could be small.

,"# YouTube Video &amp; Audio Relays

**Note**: This will be the first webcast I'll be using [my new YouTube API based ""wait for start"" script](https://old.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/h8mold/starlink9_launch_campaign_thread/fx3o1h7/). I planned to use it on the Starlink 9 mission for the first time, but since that got scrubbed, ANASIS-II will now be the premiere. I worked out some kinks that ate up my daily API quota multiple times, but now it should be stable. I'll hopefully be around to watch how it behaves and intervene if anything goes wrong.

As usual, I will relay the SpaceX webcast via HTTPS and the audio stream via Shoutcast on my server, so people with no access to YouTube, experiencing laggy video or with low bandwidth connections are able to enjoy the webcast. If you don't like the web-based player, you can also use the M3U8 playlist in any [HLS-capable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) player - VLC is just one example. The playlist file will become available once the webcast starts, until then you will get a ""404 Not Found"" error. This is perfectly normal.

### Hosted Webcast (Video)

- Watch in your browser: https://codav.de/spacex.html
- Watch with a local player: https://codav.de/stream/spacex.m3u8

I will also provide audio-only streams of the webcasts in two different qualities.

In any case, a redundant engine has to be already running to be able to step in. Consider the several seconds of S2 cooling in and startup time on Falcon 9!

Just a random suggestion this, but do so without lengthening the critical path, they could be planning to fly a designated engine-redundancy test article, and work towards skydiver flight on another vehicle.

,"Not much to discuss, it's already very well studied. 301 stainless has 0.15% carbon and 304L has 0.045% max. Higher carbon content is great for tensile strength because the tiny carbon atoms get into crystal structure dislocations and ""lock"" them together (imagine sliding two pieces of wood across each other, then add some sand and note how much harder it is to slide them.)

Since the grains can't slide relative to each other very well, you can stress the bulk material much further before plastic deformation. But the carbon content has a drawback because when you heat up 301 (as in a weld) you will see chromium attaching to the carbon in the molten metal and sort of falling out of solution as chromium carbide. Since your corrosion resistance comes  largely from the chromium, this means you're ending up with chromium depleted areas wherever you welded. Welds are often already weak points, but once you factor in advanced corrosion, they're gonna break.

304 is generally less prone to this carbide precipitation issue by virtue of having less carbon content (0.08%.) If that's not low enough for you, there's 304L at 0.045%. The 304s also have a higher nickel and chromium content, which makes them more expensive, but this offsets the lack of carbon a little bit. This makes it much easier to weld, too.",/r/spacex/comments/h9q0k1/elon_musk_on_twitter_tank_didnt_burst_but_leaked/fyjjz2v/,224,1316

,"I'm not 100% sure of this, but I think for geostationary launches, using the same launch time keeps all of the burns the same, going to geo transfer orbit.

It shouldn't be that hard to adjust things to get to the target orbit from any time of launch. Basically the plan always is:

1. Launch to LEO
2. Do a second stage burn as you cross the equator. That puts the apogee of the GTO (Geo Transfer Orbit) on the equator.
3. At apogee, the satellite is moving slowest, relative to the Earth. This is the best time to do a plane change. Depending on the mass of the satellite, the plane change burn can be done by the second stage, but for heavier satellites, it is normal for this burn to be done by a kick stage or onboard thrusters. The plane change can be done a little at a time, over several orbits, or all at once.
4. After plane change, the orbit gets circularized. This is usually done by onboard thrusters, and can use quite a bit of fuel.
5. Finally, to arrive at the correct longitude, the orbit can be left just a little high or low, so that the period is slightly more or less that 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.1 seconds. When the satellite gets to the target longitude, a very slight burn matches the orbit to the Earth's rotation.

There is nothing in the above that requires a launch to be at a particular time. You just want to miss the ISS, and any other satellites, so you time your launch to give good margins of safety.",/r/spacex/comments/htptvr/targeting_monday_july_20_for_falcon_9_launch_of/fyjjkcy/,274,1434

Re-entry is always considered the most dangerous part of the trip.  They test the engines.  They have all sorts of abort procedures during launch.  They can escape from an exploding rocket.  They can burn a little longer if an engine fails to ignite.  

But they can't abort from a re-entry.  It's an all or nothing, one-way trip through fiery, intense heat, and there's not a single thing they can do about it if something decides to fail.

Thx for posting here!

&gt; I'm a huge SpaceX supporter

Had SpaceX handled relations with neighbors a little better (particularly as regards financial compensation), the support would be more general.  

I think the environmental impact should not be a ""for or against"" partisan issue. Objective questions need asking, such as noise impact on wildlife during launch. Clearly, Falcon 9 (for which the past studies were carried out) is not SuperHeavy. Consider its effects on birds. We may thus wonder about how its sound propagates underwater, and include its effects on fish.  There needs to be a Superheavy noise model that can be used anywhere else in the context of Earth-to-Earth destinations.

,"While I generally agree with that sentiment, there is a BIT of a hand-waggle from me.

To use a completely unrealistic strawman example, what if we could permanently solve the world's energy crisis, but to do so involved destroying the protected last remaining nesting ground for some animal, effectively guaranteeing it goes extinct? Would the loss not be worth the advantage? Sure, we could try and shove the species into a conservation environment like a zoo, take DNA samples in the hopes of resurrecting them later, etc which would further reduce the ""loss"", but the core principal is ""Is it possible for the gain to humanity to be worth the loss to the natural world?"".

I think we can agree that there IS a line somewhere that as long as the boons are X good and the loss is only Y bad, then it would be crazy not to, it's only really a matter of where that line belongs.

I'm a huge SpaceX supporter - you won't find a more enthusiastic one. Most everyone I know around here is the same.

But access to that beach is really important to the people around here. I don't see any good reason to cut off public access to it (except during actual launches and static tests - that's fine, esp. if not on weekends or holidays).

There's an equally nice beach on the Mexican side, but that requires a 90 minute drive, and then re-crossing in to the US afterward, which can take hours (there's often a long line to get thru Customs).

There's a nice beach on South Padre Island - also over an hour away, each way (vs. 10 minutes).

The turtles have been there for ever - nobody (serious) ever proposed shutting down the beach for the turtles - that's just a rotten excuse. There are big signs saying to stay away from turtle nests (which people obey) and not to drive on the dunes (which most people obey - a little enforcement would go a long way).

SpaceX is important. Really important. But it's not the only thing that's important. The citizens of Brownsville shouldn't be made to suffer for SpaceX. 

It's not necessary, and it would only destroy the goodwill that people have for SpaceX.

These human populations themselves along with their industry could easily use the same technology to lift their industrial activities into space, reducing encroachment on the original environment.

Even better, lofting ecosystems into space would over time create enormous redundancy, where every species on Earth today could survive even if the entire planet was blown to bits.

If one species dies out, ecosystems drive themselves back into equilibrium by increasing/decreasing populations of other species. 

In short, ecosystems have incredible self regulating capabilities. Of course it'll be a dick move to make species extinct through deliberate human action. But even in the off-chance humans did it, the ecosystem will self-regulate itself back into equilibrium.",/r/spacex/comments/hteqyq/faa_spacex_environmental_review_underway_to/fyh13vw/,151,971

&gt;In fact, as you get further from the equator I would assume the antenna would point closer the equator (with 53 degrees being straight up).

They are also not allowed to transmit within a certain number of degrees of GEO to prevent interference with GEOsats.  This punches a big hole in the southern sky at higher latitudes.

They will probably want to point the boresight north halfway between the minimum permitted altitude and the northern edge of the protected GEO zone.  So somewhere near the north celestial pole. How close will depend on the relative widths of the exclusion zones I mentioned above.

[This document](https://llis.nasa.gov/lesson/759) states that the factory joints were different than the field joints, because they were continuously covered by asbestos/silica insulation, and perhaps were cast already assembled: the phrase ""continuous insulation and propellant strata over the factory joints"" (section 4) seems to imply that they connected the pairs of segments, insulated them, and then cast the propellant.  If they were assembled after casting just before shipping, the insulation/propellant wouldn't have been continuous.

So why not just skip the factory joint entirely?  I found some evidence that maybe they were manufactured in seven sections because of difficulty making steel cylinders large enough out of one piece of metal.  Some [design docs](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19920000825.pdf) for the in-development ASRM booster redesign imply that the case is near the limit of what they were able to forge at the time (p. 15), and welding was considered risky because it was hard to guarantee or detect a defect-free seam.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fygnhpy/,199,1334

When they launch to the ISS, the launch time gets 24 minutes earlier every day, so that's probably how long it takes (23h 36 min) between times that it passes over the same place.

There are sixteen days between now and splashdown.  16 days x 24 minutes/day = 384 minutes = 6h 24 minutes.

Therefore, if they're splashing down around 3 p.m. EDT, it would be in the same node that the ISS will be at about 9:24 p.m. EDT today.

Looking at the [live tracking map](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/tracking_map.cfm) for the ISS's location, it looks like for both this past orbit and the upcoming one, the path over Florida and/or the Atlantic Ocean was the ascending node.

So, it looks like it's going to be on an ascending node when they re-enter.

The fact that it's happening mid-afternoon probably won't help matters in terms of visibility.  DM-1 re-entered about 2 hours after sunrise in March; this is entering in mid-afternoon in August.

The question is how much methalox propellant is lost per hour from those uninsulated main tanks due to boiloff  while loitering in LEO and how much boiloff loss can be tolerated without compromising the mission. 

So can Starship fly the Apollo 4 mission? That is, can Starship orbit the Earth twice (3 hours) to phase the trajectory correctly for a Boca Chica landing while losing propellant in the main tanks due to boiloff; then fire the Raptors for several minutes in a simulated TLI burn; then coast on an elliptical orbit with apogee around 20,000 km for 4.5 hours while losing more propellant due to boiloff; and then still have enough methalox propellant left after 7.5 hours of flight in the main tanks to do another several minute Raptor burn to increase the speed to 11.13 km/sec?

I don't know the answer since Elon has not shared any information on rate of boiloff from those uninsulated main propellant tanks. 

As I said before, I think Elon should send Starship on a free-return trajectory around the Moon to do this heat shield test. That would test the heat shield in a real lunar return flight, not in a simulated flight.

,"It's the nature of the upgrades that interests me the most, can you point me towards somewhere I can learn more about them?  The only official notes I've found about the solar panel degradation are focused on not knowing how quickly they degrade on orbit over time and needing to test their output regularly to map out that degradation cycle.  

I'm trying to find a source to validate that there's a design change intended to correct a known deficiency because I'm starting to think this may be a community theory/misunderstanding about the degradation tests that's in the process of being upgraded to ""fact"" status alongside some other historical mistakes like ""NASA hates legs through heatshield is why there's no propulsive Dragon landing"" and ""they just dump the LOX overboard when they scrub a launch because it's so cheap"".  

If this is another example of ""everyone has decided X"" without NASA or SpaceX's input, then it'd be good to find that out now.

Wait, are you saying that Starship can‚Äôt loiter in LEO for a few hours, if it has any fuel in the main tanks?  Due to the heat radiating from the Earth in LEO?

Then how will refueling ops work?  Crew Dragon took 24 hours to rendezvous and dock with the space station.  Even Soyuz takes 6 hours.  Starship can probably dock with a tanker quicker than that.  But then you need time to actually transfer the fuel too.

I‚Äôm sure they can eventually speed up the process.  But at first, they‚Äôll surely want to take it slow.  Maybe several aborted docking attempts before success.

On a side note, this got me wondering about whether or not the FH could feasibly lift the James Webb Space Telescope. The Ariane V's fairing diameter is 5.4m while the FH's is 5.2m, but the FH can throw roughly twice as much mass into GTO. It seems like the difference could be made up with a larger fairing without exceeding any structural limits or causing excess aerodynamic instability, but I'm not going to say that with any certainty.

I know putting a payload on a different rocket is a lot more than just matching up the volume and mass requirements, but if the Ariane V launcher that's supposed to send the JWST up is going to be retired in a few years, it might come to that. But then again, Starship would still probably be a better choice.

I guess I just really want to see FH lift something cool. It's a shame that the second most powerful orbital launcher ever made is probably just not going to see much use.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fydllya/,181,972

,"Congratulations again!

I learned some basic information about [SpaceX Dragon 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2#cite_note-10) from wikipedia. The Dragon 2 use x86 to control and PowerPC to actuation, i think those two types of CPU are both customized  for the Dragon 2. Can you explain something about the difference between the dedicated CPU and the ordinary CPU (both x86 and PowerPC)? Whether to include some special instruction sets that ordinary CPU does not have?  And when you are writing code, do you need to do something special to match the dedicated CPU?

As a programmer, I am very curious about flight control software.

Does the flight control software run in the ROM or does it run in the operating system?

If it run in the operating system,  Linux? or some other customized system?

Final question, I only know bit flip will cause program error, so there must be parity. Are there any other conditions that will cause the program to run incorrectly? if so, how to deal with it. I thought about this for a long time, but i can't think of other situations that might cause program error. But! But! i always feel that there will be other situations that will lead to program errors.

I sincerely hope to get your answers.",/r/spacex/comments/gxb7j1/we_are_the_spacex_software_team_ask_us_anything/fydccld/,209,1250

They don't do a WDR until they're confident the systems can handle it.  It's like a final checkout.  There are no doubt additional specific tests in place now to make sure the GSE is up to the task.

The WDR here will follow any inert tests of GSE, pumps, the tank farm itself, and of course Starship.  But I suspect the real pucker factor will come from that new GSE.

,"&gt; If it doesn't get cancelled again last minute

I think what we've been seeing is them canceling the *road closures* at the last minute, not necessarily cancelling the *tests*. We can only see one of those two, and for a long time it seemed like they were closely correlated, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. In fact, I'd say that things seemed to change around the time they got their FAA permit back in May. 

We're not seeing them get set up for a test and cancel it, what it seems like is happening is they're booking road closures for anytime they might want to do a test, and then canceling them if they don't need them. And maybe they're getting a bit lazy or something and not canceling them until the last minute or they're keeping them ""just in case"" they want to move something?

Once we start to signs of activity of a test I wouldn't expect them to cancel it at the last minute. If they find a problem during testing, they'll probably stop the test at that point though. But we're just left to guess what's actually happening because we have such limited public information (although it's *much* more than what's available for most rocket development programs).",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fyd820x/,215,1191

,"Right, so here's where it gets complicated. It really just depends on how much fuel you want to spend, and how much planning you do.

I've heard that about 3 or 4.5 hours is about the best reasonably possible, and 6 hours I think is the record so far, to get to the ISS. But it takes more fuel to do that.

So if the ISS isn't in an ideal spot, you're going to spend more time, and/or more fuel, in order to get to proper orbit.

Since fuel is expensive, and significantly more fuel is needed to launch that fuel to get into orbit, they tend to work with very thin margins and very little excess fuel.

So the full answer is really that with the amount of fuel loaded onto a falcon 9 for the purpose of getting to the ISS, and the cryogenically cold oxygen required, the launch windows are instantaneous. If you miss the window, there isn't enough fuel on board to get there in reasonable time, and even if there was, it'd be too warm after 35 minutes or so to be used.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fyd2d0s/,188,969
,"So, keeping it simple, you have a return line adjacent to the feed line, within the same insulation/protection envelope. Prior to ultra-cold fueling the entire loop is brought down to the desired temperature by circulating through the loop. Additional cooling therefor need only be located within the tank farm a safe distance away. Presuming that fast loading of the fuel is also a goal, once the entire feed loop is at the desired temperature the 'return' can also acts as a 'feed', doubling capacity.",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fyd217u/,84,503

,"It's not so much where the ISS is in its orbital plane, but rather how that orbital plane sweeps around the earth (due to the earth's rotation). They want to launch when that plane crosses Cape Canaveral so the capsule's orbital plane lines up. They could probably afford the fuel to adjust the plane a few degrees either way (20 minutes earlier or later corresponds to 5 degrees of plane difference), but that's not enough leeway to detank and start over, so they just aim for the ideal moment.

If the ISS happens to be in the right spot in its orbit at the moment the plane sweeps over the Cape, then a short 6-hour rendezvous is possible. Otherwise the capsule spends longer in a lower orbit below the ISS until it can catch up.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fycxd54/,135,732
,"Interesting points but I do have a couple counters:

""Test the SH landing sequence with 3 engines and a 20-100km hop before attempting landings with 20-30 engines""

I don't think we will ever see a 20-30 engine landing,  thrust levels would be way too high (dry mass of SH is thought to be in the 300t range) . Most engine configuration layouts with the current 31 engine booster indicate a center cluster of 7 engines.  The expectation is that the 7 engines or some subset of those 7 which gimble will be used for landing.   

Also when they manage to stick the 20km landing there really isn't much value in doing higher hops.  When they perform the flip / landing burn (SS) they will be at terminal velocity even when falling form 20kms  so there really isn't much difference if they are falling form 20km or 100km or any sub orbital altitude for that matter.  I am certainly no expert here but i would bet that once they stick the 20km landing the next milestone would be orbital.

We are also somewhat confusing the SS and SH here.  I don't think they need a SH for a 3 engine SS  20km hop + land.  The SH testing program will be interesting.  They aren't breaking nearly as much new ground with SH as they are with SS so we may see them do static fire followed by a launch attempt, with RTLS. If it works,  great if it does not it ends up in the ocean,  can't get much safer than that.

And a 2nd test stand far away from the first could alleviate the bottleneck in testing and reduce the impact of a RUD.  

And [u/Acadene](https://www.reddit.com/u/Acadene/)'s theory of this being for a crane isn't out of the question yet either (if not now, it might serve as the foundation for the future one).

,"That was the Apollo 4 mission (9 Nov 1967). This was the first Apollo mission using a Saturn V launch vehicle with a lunar module test article and a Block 1 CSM (Spacecraft 017). The mission launched from Pad 39A and landed in the primary recovery area in the Pacific Ocean 8.5 hours later.

The S-IVB stage inserted the spacecraft into a LEO parking orbit. After two revolutions in the parking orbit, the S-IVB stage was reignited for a simulated translunar injection (TLI) burn. The S-IVB was jettisoned and the SM engine was ignited for a short-duration burn to raise the apogee altitude to 9769 n. mi. (18,092 km). 

The CSM coasted for 4.5 hours in an attitude designed to thermally condition the CM ablative heat shield on the conical side of the spacecraft. The SM engine was reignited for a long duration burn and the CM and SM were separated. Atmospheric entry at 400,000 ft (122 km)  occurred with an inertial velocity of 36,629 ft/sec (11.16 km/sec) at a flight path angle of 6.93 degrees. Peak load factor was 7.27 g. The CM splashed down within 10 n. mi. (18.5 km) of the targeted landing point. This was the first recovery of the CM by parachute.

Maximum heat load was 120 kW/m^2. Maximum surface temperature approached 5000F (2760C, 3033 Kelvin).",/r/spacex/comments/hf368o/starship_development_thread_12/fyc4xfk/,221,1262

However, Russian rocket engineers and technicians were only being paid about $200/month at the time. Now, Russian rocket builders are paid roughly 5 times as much, so I believe NASA is paying for all 3 seats, every time an American rides to the ISS on a Soyuz.

CST-100 and Atlas 5 are built by very inefficient methods, compared to Soyuz, and Falcon 9/Dragon 2. Boeing probably also added a substantial profit margin, but the real costs of building a rocket and capsule the Boeing/Lockheed way, is much more expensive than the Spacex way. The heat shield, software development and testing, and data communications within the capsule and rocket are all areas where it is known the Spacex way is many times cheaper, as well as being demonstrably  better.",/r/spacex/comments/hsbm9f/falcon_9_rocket_arrives_for_nasas_spacex_crew1/fybvvcn/,174,990

,"One of the pieces that makes it difficult to compare to existing hardware is the phased antenna array. The array is physically flat, which means the elements are likely dual-polarized patches. The FCC filings refer to circular polarization, which can be achieved on a dual linear polarized antenna by phase shifting one of the polarizations by 90¬∞.

To achieve beam steerability with null cancelation, you need something like 8x8 dual polarized elements. Maybe you can sparsely populate the array and can get away with 48 different elements or so. The round antenna is probably comprised of a circularly truncated square array.

From here there are two options: independent, low-powered transmit/receive chains for each element and polarization with beam forming done by digitally controlling the phase shifts and amplitudes, OR split a high powered transmit/receive chain with power divider/combiners and perform the beam forming with RF attenuators and phase shifters.

Both of these options necessitate a lot of power on the front end because a lot of power is lost/used along the way. Yeah, in the end the effective EIRP will be something like a 5-10W average power transmitter, but you have to double that because of the polarization and I would guess 5-10x *that* for losses due to the phased array.

Edit: one other reason why I would guess that power range is because IEEE 802.3bt or some of the proprietary PoE standards (like LTPoE++) provide for 71-90W over a standard CAT5E cable to a powered device. Some proprietary standards can push it to 120W and I'm guessing that the engineers were lobbying hard for as much power as possible on the front end so they weren't as constrained on the other end.",/r/spacex/comments/hrlo9m/code_on_spacexs_starlink_website_contains_the/fybot6w/,283,1710

Also the curing process for the solid fuel, I‚Äôm not sure on the actual limitations on how large of a casting you can do with it (I tried to find some kind of academic paper but was unsuccessful) but that could have added limitations to the size as well. Before the boosters left the manufacturing plant they would join 6 of the 7 sections in pairs and those joints also had the same O-rings that would later be used in the final assembly of the now 4 sections.

I definitely expect more launches from SpaceX than 2019 in the summer, but we will most likely not see the cadence we saw during the winter and spring.

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX ANASIS-II Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shahar603, your launch host for this mission[.](https://airbus-h.assetsadobe2.com/is/image/content/dam/products-and-solutions/space/telecommunication/eurostar/ANASIS-II_shipment_Copyright_Airbus.jpg?wid=1920&amp;fit=fit,1&amp;qlt=85,0)

## Overview

ANASIS-II is a South Korean military communications satellite, built by Airbus Defense and Space and operated by South Korea's Agency for Defense Development. Based on the Eurostar-3000 platform the satellite will operate in geostationary orbit and provide wide coverage over the Korean Peninsula. A Falcon 9 rocket will deliver the spacecraft to a geostationary transfer orbit and the booster will land on a drone ship downrange.

Per the customer's request, live coverage will end shortly after first stage landing.

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX GPS III SV03 (Columbus) Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

Hello everybody, I am u/Marc020202, and it has been a while since I hosted the last thread!

**Mission Overview** 

This mission launches the third GPS III satellite into orbit and is the second GPS launch for SpaceX. Although the GPS III SV01 launch aboard Falcon 9 expended the booster, this mission's booster will be recovered via ASDS landing. The destination orbit, however, is unchanged. SpaceX is also planning to launch at least 3 further GPS III missions.

# Primary Mission: Deployment of payload into the correct orbit

Since the press kit for this Mission has not been released yet, it is not 100% clear how the mission will be executed, however, it is likely that like the GPS SV1 mission back in 2018 the Second stage will target a parking orbit first, before Igniting the Merlin Vacuum engine again, boosting the satellite into a 20200km by 1200km Orbit with an inclination of 55¬∞. The first stage engine burn will likely be a bit shorter to save fuel to allow B1060 to reenter and land.

At the start of thread #12 Starship SN5 has just moved to the launch site and is preparing for testing. Starship SN6 consists of a fully stacked propulsion section at the assembly site. Starship test articles are expected to make several suborbital hops in the coming months beginning with a 150 meter hop and progressing toward a 20 km hop. Orbital flight requires the SuperHeavy booster, for which [a new high bay is soon to be erected](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1269418186757206016 'Tweet by @elonmusk'). SpaceX continues to focus heavily on development of its Starship production line in Boca Chica, TX.

## Rules
We will attempt to keep this self-post current with links and major updates, but for the most part, we expect the community to supply the information. This is a great place to discuss Starhip development, ask Starship-specific questions, and track the progress of the production and test campaigns. **Starship Development Threads are not party threads. Normal subreddit rules still apply.**

,"#[We're pleased to announce, Dr. Robert Zubrin will be returning to r/SpaceX for another AMA next Saturday in conjunction with The Mars Society.](https://i.imgur.com/QBmST0K.png)

While I'm sure that Dr. Zubrin needs no introduction for most of us here, for those of you who are new, [Dr. Zubrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zubrin) is of course the Mars Society President and one of the founders since 1998. Earth's most famous and passionate advocate for Mars, backing that energy with serious engineering knowledge, working on hundreds of space exploration and nuclear tech research papers, including the famous [Mars Direct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Direct) mission! He has also authored or co-authored over a dozen books, just last year publishing [The Case for Space](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HDSSKHJ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0). (My favourite is [The Case for Mars](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Mars-Plan-Settle-Planet/dp/145160811X), but I highly recommend both books.) Not to mention literally hundreds of interviews on the subject (many available on youtube). Zubrin has spent his considerable talents towards figuring out exactly how to get to Mars for decades; With SpaceX being created with nearly the sole purpose of getting humanity to Mars, there is a deep shared purpose, with Dr. Zubrin keenly watching SpaceX from the start with as much interest as any of us, even helping shape Musk's passion for Mars as a destination.

With more than a week until the AMA, I recommend checking out [last year's AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/e0kqpk/im_robert_zubrin_ama_noon_pacific_today/) which was a wealth of information. Of course, any of his books are highly recommended. More recently, there is [this 2 parter interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwdipsDsQYs) directly about SpaceX, Musk and how they change our path to Mars. Recently Zubrin has also penned numerous [articles](https://spacenews.com/op-ed-toward-a-coherent-artemis-plan/) analyzing the lunar [Artemis plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program) which SpaceX has recently become a part of with Dragon XL and Starship HLS contracts in the early stages. Dr. Zubrin also spoke with Musk at Boca Chica as recently as February and wrote about that [here](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/02/mars-elon-musk-plan-to-settle-red-planet/?fbclid=IwAR3HY65gnvLUZQsOdAkksEF4PCF1Aql3VJflaIAugd2C6inFdG8lDdP7RbM). While a week is not enough to read a fraction of Dr. Zubrin's work, I hope most of you will check some of it out prior to the AMA, it is inspiring stuff!

Looking forward to another solid AMA!

Special thanks to Edward Heisler and Lucinda Offer of The Mars Society ( https://www.marssociety.org/ ) for helping put together this AMA. You can get involved without ever leaving reddit on r/MarsSociety . They also have their [**23rd** annual international convention](https://www.marssociety.org/conventions/2020/) happening on Oct 15~18 which is online this year and free to join, a good chance to further get involved in getting our asses to Mars.",/r/spacex/comments/hbk3ob/how_to_get_to_mars_dr_zubrin_ama_saturday_27th/,406,3105

#Starlink-9 (STARLINK V1.0-L9)

## Overview

The tenth Starlink launch overall and the ninth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy 58-60 Starlink satellites into an elliptical orbit roughly 25 minutes into the flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. This mission includes the second rideshare on a Starlink mission, with [two of BlackSky's satellites on top of the Starlink stack](https://spacenews.com/blacksky-launching-two-satellites-on-june-starlink-mission/). The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 632 km downrange.

,"What an awesome launch, just like always! As I was reading the stats about everything, this launch seemed especially interesting from a financial perspective. The new elements (ride-share with Skysat and foregoing a static fire) stand out to me as not just technically interesting, but also potentially financially interesting:

1. Skysat is a paying customer. It's well-known that SpaceX's internal costs for launching boosters are likely well-below what they charge commercial customers...but it still does cost them money. By dropping 2 Starlink satellites and making room for a few Skysat ride-shares, they're now lowering their own internal launch costs. I have no idea by how much, Skysat just said they got a ""good deal"", so I'm guessing that's probably somewhere between $1-5 million.

2. No static fire test. While this seems like just an efficiency boost (which it is), it's also a non-zero cost. The have to get their crew onsite, they likely have to pay to get NASA/FAA people onsite, they have to fuel the vehicle, pay for cryogenics, etc. This all seems trivial, and when you have a rocket launching for $150 million it is; but when you have a rocket that can be launched multiple times, decreasing its per-launch price each time it goes up, you have to start looking for financial savings elsewhere.

SpaceX appears to just really aggressively to be looking for any way to (safely) cut cost-per-flight down. This is similar to catching their fairings, which are a rounding-error on expendable launches, but actually do start to add up when you're reusing your rockets.

All this to say, this is why I think SpaceX is so much better positioned to build something like Starlink, and why I really don't think there will ever be other competitors. They already have 500+ satellites in orbit when their next closest competitor just declared bankruptcy, and the next closest after that just issues press-releases about their plans and performs one sub-orbital flight every year. Meanwhile, SpaceX is aggressively getting their launch costs down and putting 100+ satellites in orbit per month.",/r/spacex/comments/h8ah79/starlink_the_ocho_launch_seems_to_be_really/,343,2101

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 8 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shaha603, your host for this mission[.](https://i.redd.it/ck3ipxff9c451.png)

**Mission Overview**

The ninth Starlink launch overall and the eighth operational batch‚Ä† of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy 58 satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. Riding along are 3 SkySat satellites launched for planet labs. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.
Half of Falcon 9‚Äôs fairing previously flew on the JCSAT-18/Kacific1 mission, and the other half previously flew on SpaceX‚Äôs third Starlink mission. 

‚Ä† The first Starlink mission launched a batch of prototype satellites that do not form part of the operational constellation.

,"Potentially huge good news for Starlink:

1. FCC will hold an auction in October 29 to award $16B subsidy over 10 years for building up broadband infrastructure for rural America.

2. The auction has two latency tiers high and low, the low latency tier requires latency to be less than 100ms, and vendors in this tier will have a big advantage in auction.

3. SpaceX has been arguing Starlink can meet this latency threshold, but since they (and all the other LEO constellation) are not in commercial service yet, there're proposals to forbid them from bidding on low latency tier at all.

4. Less than a months ago, FCC released a document stating LEO constellation is not allowed to bid on the low latency tier, this would make it difficult for Starlink to get significant amount of subsidy from this program.

5. Today FCC took a vote on whether to go ahead with the auction, it looks like just before the vote they changed their stands on the issue and now allows LEO constellation like Starlink to bid on low latency tier.

6. In order to get the subsidy, Starlink still need to prove its latency to FCC's satisfaction and will need to face off the other broadband providers in the auction, but this could potentially allow Starlink to get significant amount of subsidy (i.e. multiple of billions) from this program, it could be a huge boost for Starlink and Starship in terms of funding.

References:

1. [Chairman Ajit Pai's statement](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/060962555534/DOC-364811A2.pdf):

    &gt; And, at the request of one of my fellow commissioners, **we also don‚Äôt entirely close the door on low earth orbit satellite providers bidding in the low-latency tier.** However, it is also important to keep in mind the following point: The purpose of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund is to ensure that Americans have access to broadband, no matter where they live. It is not a technology incubator to fund untested technologies. And we will not allow taxpayer funding to be wasted. A new technology may sound good in theory and look great on paper. But this multi-billion-dollar broadband program will require ‚Äút‚Äùs to be crossed‚Äînot fingers. So any such application will be given very close scrutiny.

2. [Commissioner Michael O'Rielly's statement](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/060962555534/DOC-364811A3.pdf):

    &gt; **I am grateful to the Chairman for agreeing to expand eligibility for the low-latency performance tier and change language that was prejudicial to certain providers.** While a technology neutral policy across the board may have been more effective in promoting innovation and maximizing the value of ratepayer investments, I recognize that a balancing act was necessary to reach the current disposition. I also thank the Chairman for agreeing to clarify that the Commission will re-evaluate the eligibility conditions prior to moving forward with the second phase of the auction. Communications technology evolves at an extremely rapid pace, and who knows which technologies will have advanced or emerged by the time we get to Phase II?

3. [Commissioner Geoffrey Starks's statement](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/060962555534/DOC-364811A6.pdf):

    &gt; The ten-year term the Commission chose in January has additional ramifications for this Public Notice. Committing so much of the budget for so long raises the stakes on how we treat emerging technologies and technical capabilities. **I appreciate Commissioner O‚ÄôRielly‚Äôs work in revising this Public Notice to eliminate the categorical bar on low earth orbit satellite systems bidding in the lowlatency tier, especially now that we have evidence in the record that those systems can meet the 100-millisecond latency standard.** At the same time, I see no need for the Public Notice‚Äôs predictive judgments about the merits of short-form applications from low earth orbit satellite operators. As I have stated previously, **next-generation satellite broadband holds tremendous technological promise for addressing the digital divide and is led by strong American companies with a lengthy record of success.** Commission staff should evaluate those applications on their own merits.

4. Possible reason for FCC's change of mind, [found by u/softwaresaur](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/gzszn0/the_proposal_also_will_allow_low_earth_orbit/ftjjlh8/): [SpaceX held 3 day meeting with FCC on May 27/28/29](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/106012288627473/RDOF%20Ex%20Parte%20(6-1-2020\)%20(REDACTED\).pdf) to present [confidential test data that shows Starlink can indeed meet the low latency criteria](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10529094752788/SpaceX%20RDOF%20Ex%20Parte%20Confidentiality%20Request%20for%20Exhibit%20A%20(5-29-2020\).pdf):

    &gt; ...  on May 27, 28, and 29, 2020, ... SpaceX discussed [with the FCC] the draft Public Notice that would establish procedures for Auction 904. As demonstrated in Exhibit A, SpaceX explained that its system easily clears the Commission‚Äôs 100 ms threshold for low-latency services, even including its ‚Äúprocessing time‚Äù during unrealistic worst-case situations.

    &gt; Exhibit A, which is marked as ‚ÄúConfidential Information,‚Äù concerns SpaceX‚Äôs proprietary network latency testing information and internal performance data. This is company-specific, competitively-sensitive, business confidential and/or proprietary and commercial information concerning SpaceX‚Äôs operations that would not routinely be made available to the public, and has been carefully guarded from competitors. If it were disclosed, SpaceX‚Äôs potential competitors could use it to determine information regarding SpaceX‚Äôs competitive position, operations, and performance, and could use that information to gain a competitive advantage over SpaceX.

5. Some news articles, although they don't get into as much details:

* [FCC awarding up to $16 billion to address U.S. areas lacking broadband service](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-telecom-internet/fcc-awarding-up-to-16-billion-to-address-u-s-areas-lacking-broadband-service-idUSKBN23G29R?utm_source=reddit.com): This is already posted to this subreddit, but it's really vague.

* [FCC Clears Way for SpaceX to Vie for Rural Broadband Subsidies](https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/fcc-clears-way-for-spacex-to-vie-for-rural-broadband-subsidies): A better article that included some quotes from Pai and O‚ÄôRielly



PS: FCC has 5 commissioners including the chairman, only 3 commissioners may be members of the same political party. Pai and O'Rielly are Republican and Starks is a Democrat, so it looks like this decision has bi-partisan support.",/r/spacex/comments/h04on0/fcc_just_voted_to_allow_starlink_to_bid_on_low/,914,6635

#GPS Block III, Space Vehicle 3 (Columbus)

## Overview

GPS III are the third generation of the U.S. Space Force's NAVSTAR Global Positioning System satellites. The GPS III development contract was awarded to a team led by Lockheed Martin. Block III will improve position, navigation, and timing services for warfighter and civil users yielding superior system security, accuracy and reliability. When fully deployed, the GPS III constellation will feature a cross-linked command and control architecture, allowing the entire GPS constellation to be updated simultaneously from a single ground station. Additionally, a new spot beam capability for enhanced military (M-Code) coverage and increased resistance to hostile jamming will be incorporated. These enhancements will contribute to improved accuracy and assured availability for military and civilian users worldwide.

Lockheed Martin's flight-proven A2100 bus serves as the GPS III spacecraft platform. Unlike the GPS IIF satellite, the GPS III satellite features an apogee propulsion system. The satellite features a LEROS-1C engine as an apogee propulsion system as well as 2 deployable solar arrays to generate power. ITT, Clifton, N.J. provides the navigation payload, and General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems, Gilbert, Ariz., provides the Network Communications Element (NCE) which includes the UHF Crosslink and Tracking Telemetry &amp; Command (TT&amp;C) subsystems.

This mission launches the third GPS III satellite into orbit, and is the second GPS launch for SpaceX. Although the GPS III SV01 launch aboard Falcon 9 expended the booster, this mission's booster will be recovered via ASDS landing.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather, and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

,"It's that time again! As per usual, we like to keep things as tight as possible. If you have content you created to share, whether that be images of the launch, videos, GIF's, etc, they go here.
# Photographer Contest
We decided to try out something new this time. 

 This time we are running a contest in this thread. You can submit your pictures related to this mission. That might be Falcon 9 on the launch pad, a launch picture or a streak shot of a starlink overfly. We will put this thread into contest mode and announce the winner when the droneship arrives back at Port Canaveral.

The winner will be allowed to post their picture directly on r/SpaceX and will get a special flair.

Rules:

- If no post reaches more than +10 votes , no winner will be selected
- You need to own the picture you are submitting
- 1 picture per person ( If you want to show more mark the one you are entering with #Contest)

If you have any feedback or ideas how to improve this contest, please send us a modmail!


## *As usual, our standard media thread rules apply:*

* **All top level comments must consist of an image, video, GIF, tweet or article.**
* If you're an amateur photographer, submit your content here. Professional photographers with subreddit accreditation can continue to submit to the front page, we also make exceptions for outstanding amateur content!
* Those in the aerospace industry (with subreddit accreditation) can likewise continue to post content on the front page.
* Mainstream media articles should be submitted here. Quality articles from dedicated spaceflight outlets *may* be submitted to the front page.
* **Direct all questions to the live launch thread.**",/r/spacex/comments/gw76k5/rspacex_starlink7_media_thread_photographer/,293,1682

,"Hello! It is u/RocketLover0119 hosting the recovery thread for core B1058.1 after successfully lofting S2 and Dragon to orbit with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley for the historic DM-2 mission, which returned american astronauts, on an american rocket, from american soil, back into orbit and to the ISS. Below is a table on the ships and their duties and status, as well as updates and resources.

## About DM-2

""On Saturday, May 30 at 3:22 p.m. EDT, SpaceX‚Äôs [Falcon 9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) launched [Crew Dragon‚Äôs second demonstration (Demo-2) mission](https://www.spacex.com/static/images/launches/Dem0-2_Artwork.png) from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA‚Äôs Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the next day Crew Dragon autonomously docked to the International Space Station. This test flight with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board the [Dragon spacecraft](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/) returned human spaceflight to the United States.

Demo-2 is the final major test for SpaceX‚Äôs human spaceflight system to be certified by NASA for operational crew missions to and from the International Space Station. SpaceX is returning human spaceflight to the United States with one of the safest, most advanced systems ever built, and NASA‚Äôs Commercial Crew Program is a turning point for America‚Äôs future in space exploration that lays the groundwork for future missions to the [Moon](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/moon/), [Mars](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/), [and beyond](https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/).""

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 7 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/hitura-nobad, your host for this mission.

#  Mission Overview

The eight Starlink launch overall and the seventh operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession) rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

," This post is a compilation of Elon Musk and SpaceX presentation for Astro2020 regarding Starlink and Starship

[Jeff Foust on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/jeff_foust/status/1254818901944344576?s=20)

""Elon  Musk is giving a presentation at a public meeting of an Astro2020  astrophysics decadal survey cmte meeting on efforts to mitigate  brightness of Starlink satellites. First ‚ÄúVisorSat‚Äù satellites, with  sunshade to block reflections off antennas, planned to be on next  launch. ""

""Musk also says that  SpaceX is implementing an ‚Äúorientation roll‚Äù on those satellites whose  orbits are being raised to reduce reflections off solar panels.""

""Musk  estimates the existing Starlink satellites, including those without any  brightness mitigations, will be deorbited in 3-4 years, in part because  they‚Äôll be rendered obsolete by v2 satellites with  ‚Äúfar greater  throughput.‚Äù""

""Musk says darkening the satellites is ‚Äúquite simple, actually‚Äù and that ‚Äúwe‚Äôll feel a bit silly in hindsight.‚Äù""

""Musk:  think 550 km altitude is the right approach for LEO broadband  constellations, but don‚Äôt know if there will be a lot of other systems.  ‚ÄúThe big challenge is not going bankrupt.‚Äù ""

""Musk  says he‚Äôs ‚Äúpretty interested‚Äù to talk with astronomy community on ways  to launch or even build a large space telescope, ‚Äúmaybe a planet imager  or something like this.‚Äù""

""Musk  briefly mentions Starship launch system, says that ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see regular  flights, I think, within a couple years.‚Äù Notes that it could play a  role in launching space based telescopes. ""

[.@elonmusk  What the public sees is mostly the #Starlink objects during orbit  raise. Once the objects reach station, the source of brightness is the  reflection from antennas. We tried blacking out the antennas on Darksat  and it worked, but sun shades will work better. #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254817746224742405?s=20)

[I  will say that this presentation by @elonmusk for #Astro2020 includes  the most detailed view of the Starlink satellites I have yet seen. He's  reiterating the point about the goal of Starlink to not yield an impact  to science.](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254818492177514508?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  : We're interested in replacing the earliest Starlink sats we launched  as the tech progresses. We expect the 1st generation sats to be replaced  on a timescale of 3-4 years. We do not want 'ancient electronics' in  orbit like GEO sats up there for 15, 20 years. #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254821665264959498?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  , in response to a question from the #Astro2020 WG: We support a  regulatory framework that requires satellite operators to keep object  brightness ""within limits that don‚Äôt fundamentally inhibit science.""  #Starlink](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254819504518922253?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  reiterates: ""If there‚Äôs any situation where we‚Äôre impeding science, we  will take corrective action."" #Starlink #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254822241465860097?s=20)

[As  an aside, @elonmusk mentioned the large diameter of the Starship faring  and its ability to launch ""quite a big thing"" in it, referring to a  question about using SpaceX hardware to launch telescopes and similar  missions into space. #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254822814592335876?s=20)

[.@elonmusk  : The benefit of hindsight suggests that satellite visibility  mitigation efforts are quite simple; reduce albedo of surfaces or shade  them. ""It's not that hard."" #Starlink #Astro2020](https://twitter.com/JohnBarentine/status/1254824391621238784?s=20)

# Welcome to the r/SpaceX Starlink 6 Official Launch Discussion &amp; Updates Thread!

I'm u/Shahar603, your host for this mission.

#  Mission Overview

The seventh Starlink launch overall and the sixth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of [precession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nodal_precession) rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

,"[Elon gets into it with Eric Berger and twitterverse](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1250612062989905921), here's highlights: -

Eric Berger: ""SpaceX is surely saving money on launches, and if the Falcon 9 weren't already insanely cheaper than everyone else, the company could cut prices substantially.""

**Elon:** ""True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they‚Äôd be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying.""

Eric Berger: ""Maybe check Block 5‚Äôs record [on reliability].""

**Elon:** ""Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That‚Äôs the acid test.""

Michael Sheetz: ""How much less?""

**Elon:** ""Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only [American] rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing.""

Everyday Astronaut: ""Atlas V is an American rocket (well minus the engines ;)""

**Elon:** ""Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US.""

~~[CProphet sidenote: believe Airbus manufacture Atlas V airframe]~~ 

**Elon:** ""Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch""

**Elon:** ""Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It‚Äôs a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!""

Tobi Li: ""What Is the latest SN number for the raptor engine?""

**Elon:** ""SN26""

Sivakumar Kumar: ""What do you think about @RocketLab‚Äôs latest retrieval effort?""

**Elon:** ""Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn‚Äôt scale to bigger rockets &amp; is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it‚Äôs probably right move for small LEO vehicle.""

**Elon:** ""I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It‚Äôs very hard. I‚Äôm spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done :)""

Everyday Astronaut: ""It‚Äôs insane how quick SN4 is coming together. It makes sense when you build a factory AROUND your rockets (not vice versa), cool to see mass manufacturing taking an early lead in development vs one off prototyping. I hope when it‚Äôs closer to done I can get a tour from you ;)""

**Elon:** ""Production is by *far* the hard part. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they‚Äôre pretty sweet ‚Ä¶""

Everyday Astronaut: ""It‚Äôd be so cool to do a tour of Hawthorne vs Boca Chica and see the differences in philosophies between early SpaceX vs current. Boca Chica is just a giant playground / test bed, which is cool!""

**Elon:** ""Sure""

Keith Mansfield: ""Everything crossed for SN4. This time!""

**Elon:** ""That‚Äôs for sure! [Smiling face with open mouth and cold sweat]""

Michael Baylor: ""Will SN4 hop to 20 km or just 150 m if the pressure tests and static fire goes well?""

**Elon:** ""SN4 won‚Äôt get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator &amp; static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps.""

Analysis: Elon sounds stressed, which is understandable. Only a couple of days until SN4 pressure test - and its already made redundant by SN5/6.

#Starlink-6 (STARLINK V1.0-L6)

We are looking for launch thread hosts. If you are interested in hosting please send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fspacex).

## Overview

The seventh Starlink launch overall and the sixth operational batch of Starlink satellites will launch into orbit aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. This mission is expected to deploy all sixty satellites into an elliptical orbit about fifteen minutes into flight. In the weeks following launch the satellites are expected to utilize their onboard ion thrusters to raise their orbits to 550 km in three groups of 20, making use of precession rates to separate themselves into three planes. The booster will land on a drone ship approximately 628 km downrange.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if additions or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

## About The Recovery

SpaceX is going to conclude the CRS-20 Cargo Dragon mission to the International Space Station on April 7th with the deorbit and recovery of this spacecraft. Dragon will splash down in the Pacific Ocean approximately 815 km southwest of  Los Angeles. The west coast dragon recovery ship NRC Quest will be waiting at the landing zone to pick dragon up and bring it back to the harbour.

,"*SpaceX has provided the following statement from CONAE, translated to English, regarding the postponement of the SAOCOM 1B mission:*

**The launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite is postponed**
 
The Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation and the National Commission for Space Activities (CONAE) announce the decision to postpone the launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite, originally scheduled for the end of March.
 
This decision has been made considering the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and that could affect the availability of own resources and foreign third-party resources, necessary not only for a safe insertion into orbit, but also for further operation of the satellite.
 
This postponement has been agreed with the company providing the launch service, SpaceX, considering that it is the best decision in these moments of uncertainty and dynamism about the situation that the whole world suffers because of COVID-19.
 
This measure will be supplemented with activities at the launch base that will ensure the conditions for adequate protection of the SAOCOM 1B satellite at the SpaceX facilities.
 
The authorities of this Commission will await the evolution of the conditions that will make possible the resume of the activities related to the launch of the SAOCOM 1B satellite and its subsequent reliable injection into its final orbit according to the original plans.",/r/spacex/comments/foav19/statement_from_conae_regarding_the_postponement/,215,1400

,"Hello! it is u/RocketLover0119 back at it hosting the recovery thread for the launch of the 5th batch of operational Starlink satellites! Below is info on the mission, info on the core/fairing, updates, and more!

## About Starlink

"" SpaceX is leveraging its experience in building rockets and spacecraft to deploy the world's most advanced broadband internet system. With performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet and a global network unbounded by ground infrastructure limitations, Starlink will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable. Each Starlink satellite weights approximately 260 kg and features a compact, flat-panel design that minimizes volume, allowing for a dense launch stack to take full advantage of Falcon 9‚Äôs launch capabilities. With four powerful phased array and two parabolic antennas on each satellite, an enormous amount of throughput can be placed and redirected in a short time, for an order of magnitude lower cost than traditional satellite-based internet. Starlink satellites are on the leading edge of on-orbit debris mitigation, meeting or exceeding all regulatory and industry standards. At end of their life cycle, the satellites will utilize their on-board propulsion system to deorbit over the course of a few months. In the unlikely event their propulsion system becomes inoperable, the satellites will burn up in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere within 1-5 years, significantly less than the hundreds or thousands of years required at higher altitudes. Further, Starlink components are designed for full demisability. Starlink is targeting service in the Northern U.S. and Canada in 2020, rapidly expanding to near global coverage of the populated world by 2021. Additional information on the system can be found at starlink.com. ""

## Core B1048.5

The core utilized in this mission is core 48. This core completed a historic first for SpaceX, which is launching and landing a core for the 5th time. Previously, this core flew on the Iridium-7, SAOCOM-1A, Nusantara Satu, and the 2nd launch of Starlink missions. Unfortunately, during this mission core 48 failed to land. According to Musk, an engine turned off (some speculate an engine went boom, similar to CRS-1). The core had a good ascent until the anomaly, separated stages, deployed fins, and completed what appears to have been a 2 engine entry burn (speculation). Beyond that, it seems it didn't even light for landing, and smashed into the ocean at terminal speed. RIP B1048.

## Fairing

In this mission, the fairings are flight-proven. These 2 halves both previously supported the first launch of Starlink in May of last year, with these halves being fished from the sea by GO Navigator and GO Searcher. This is only the second time SpaceX has utilized previously flown fairings, with high hopes of continuing to recover and reuse other halves. The 2 halves were not caught, but were, however, retrieved from the ocean by Ms. tree and Ms. Chief.

,"Hey everyone,

I want to introduce my new Twitter bot to you:

#### [ The Starlink Deployment Update Bot](https://twitter.com/StarlinkUpdates)

### What can it do?
It is posting updated graphs of the Starlink satellite attitude for each launch once a day on twitter.

### How does it work?
#### Part 1: The Scrapper
It uses wget to download https://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/supplemental/starlink.txt three times a day, 1 hour after the update is released by SpaceX, and saves it onto my Server.
#### Part 2: Calculator
The next script loads the TLEs and calculates different orbit heights from them.
#### Part 3: Separator
The following script splits the TLEs after the different missions and appends to the archive of previously calculated data points for the specific launch.
#### Part 4: Generator/Plotter
The plotter uses Matplotlib to generated an updated graph from the given data and saves it as png.
#### Part 5: Poster
The last script uploads the png to twitter and posts the thread once a day.

### Future Expansions
- Possibility to highlight specific sats
- Loading additional data from the r/SpaceX API
- Plotting other interesting values than just orbital height

### Thanks
- u/thevehicledestroyer for helping to debug my TLE generation code making it more accurate
- Dr. T.S. Kelso for providing me the exact times when SpaceX publishes new TLEs",/r/spacex/comments/exrmyu/introducing_the_starlink_deployment_update_bot/,220,1369

,"Welcome to another r/SpaceX meta thread, where we talk about how the sub is running and the stuff going on behind the scenes, and where everyone can offer input on things they think are good, bad or anything in between.

Our [last meta thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/cbrhk0/july_2019_meta_thread_new_mods_new_bots/) went pretty well, so we‚Äôre sticking with the new format going forward.

In short, we're leaving this as a stub and writing up a handful of topics as top level comments to get the ball rolling. Of course, we invite you to start comment threads of your own to discuss any other subjects of interest as well.

As usual, you can ask or say anything in freely in this thread. We will only remove abusive spam and bigotry.

,"## Overview[](https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1104014992347607042/photo/1)
 
This mission is a test of Crew Dragon's abort capability as part of NASA'a Commercial Crew Integrated Capability program (CCiCap). SpaceX will launch a Crew Dragon capsule from LC-39A, Kennedy Space Center on a fully fueled Falcon 9 rocket and then trigger the launch escape system during the period of maximum dynamic pressure. The abort sequence terminates launcher thrust, separates Dragon and trunk from the second stage, and ignites the eight SuperDraco engines which pull the capsule away from the launch vehicle. Following shutdown of the SuperDracos Dragon coasts to apogee, separates from the trunk, and lands in the Atlantic Ocean under parachutes. Crew Dragon will be recovered by GO Searcher after splashdown approximately 30 km from the launch site. This flight does not go to orbit.

Falcon 9 core 1046.4 flies in expendable configuration, without legs, grid fins, or TEA-TEB engine ignition fluid. Since the abort sequence will be initiated before staging, the second stage has not been equipped with an Mvac engine or the associated hardware, but is expected to be fueled. Falcon 9 will likely break apart due to aerodynamic loads immediately following Crew Dragon's escape.

The abort test occurs approximately 80-100 seconds into flight. Breakup of Falcon 9 is expected within seconds thereafter. Splashdown of the capsule will occur within a few minutes following abort.

##Mission-Specific FAQ

###Will the flight termination system be used?

From the [Environmental Assessment](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/environmental/nepa_docs/review/launch/media/Final_EA_and_FONSI_for_SpaceX_In-flight_Dragon_Abort_508_A.pdf 'FAA.gov (PDF)') it does not appear that the autonomous flight termination system will be used. The abort sequence will be triggered by a ""simulated loss of thrust"" (rather than a disintegrating rocket). The booster is expected to become uncontrollable after Dragon separation and break apart from the intense aerodynamic forces within seconds. A conflagration is possible, but not certain.

###Is there a chance the booster will land, and what is the downrange launch hazard area for?

The Environmental Assessment explicitly states that no landing attempt (or landing gear) will be a part of this mission. Although environmental assessments often contain outdated information, this is also supported by the lack of the usual booster recovery communications permit. The downrange [launch hazard area](https://twitter.com/raul74cz/status/1212197735820083200 'Twitter, @Raul74Cz') appears to represent the improbable scenario in which the abort system fails to terminate thrust. Falcon 9 or its post reentry debris would fall in this hazard area.

We will attempt to keep the above text regularly updated with resources and new mission information, but for the most part, updates will appear in the comments first. Feel free to ping us if changes or corrections are needed. This is a great place to discuss the launch, ask mission-specific questions, and track the minor movements of the vehicle, payload, weather and more as we progress towards launch. Approximately 24 hours before liftoff, the launch thread will go live and the party will begin there.

,"JCSAT-18/Kacific1 Launch Infographic by [Geoff Barrett](https://gdbarrett.com/) coming soon!

### [-&gt; Jump to Comments &lt;-](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/{THREAD_ID_CAMPAIGN}/jcsat-18_kacific1_launch_campaign_thread/#siteTable_t3_{THREAD_ID_CAMPAIGN})

JCSAT-18 is a mobile broadband communications payload built for Sky Perfect JSAT Corporation of Japan and will service Asia Pacific. Kacific1 is a high throughput broadband internet payload built for Kacific Broadband Satellites and will service certain high demand areas of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Both payloads share a single chassis.

SpaceX will launch the Boeing built dual payload satellite to geostationary transfer orbit from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral AFS on a Falcon 9, and the first-stage booster is expected to land downrange on the OCISLY droneship.

This is SpaceX's **13th** mission of 2019, its **6th** commercial flight of the year and the **77th** Falcon 9 launch overall. It will re-use the FT Block 5 booster flown on NASA CRS-17 and CRS-18.

## Mission-Specific FAQ

### Why is this mission landing on the droneship downrange, rather than back at Cape Canaveral?

Boosting satellites into geostationary transfer orbit takes a lot more energy/delta-V (i.e. propellant) than just into low earth orbit, given the apogee of the former is 35 786 km as opposed to 200-2000 km for the latter. This requires the Falcon 9 second stage to perform a substantial extra to inject the satellite into this orbit from LEO, which requires that sufficient propellant be left over from insertion into the initial LEO parking orbit. This in turn requires the first stage to do more of the work accelerating the second stage to orbital velocity, meaning that it in turn is both traveling at a higher speed at separation and is further downrange from the Cape, while having less propellant remaining.

Therefore, with less propellant available and more required to boost back, landing on the droneship allows the booster to efficiently use its remaining propellant margin to perform an entry burn, reducing re-entry heating, and leaving it enough margin for the landing burn. 


### How come this mission is landing if its heavier than the 5500 kg reusable GTO limit?

The payload will be delivered into a subsynchronous GTO, with an apogee lower than the standard 35 786 km, which naturally takes less propellant from the second stage to raise its orbit to. Therefore, the second stage can in turn do more of the work injecting into a parking orbit, allowing the first stage enough propellant margin to land. While this results in a somewhat longer time for the satellite to come into service, and requires a larger propellant tank for its kick motor, the customer evidently decided the substantially cheaper launch cost vs. an expendable or Falcon Heavy launch was worth these relatively modest downsides. This has been done on several prior missions, such as Telstar 18V and 19V.

## Watching the Launch

Check out the [Watching a Launch page](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/faq/watching) on this sub's FAQ, which gives a summary of every viewing site and answers many more common questions, as well as [Ben Cooper's launch viewing guide](http://www.launchphotography.com/Delta_4_Atlas_5_Falcon_9_Launch_Viewing.html), [Launch Rats](https://launchrats.com/), and the [Space Coast Launch Ambassadors](https://scla.space) which have interactive maps, photos and detailed information about each site.


### I want the best view of the launch. Where should I go?

The KSCVC LC-39 gantry is indisputably the best option (cost aside) and an incredible experience, but is now sold out. The KSCVC Saturn V Center is second best, and is first come, first serve so get there early (before 9 am recommended)! Playalinda beach is the closest low-cost option by a considerable margin, though the view of the pad is obstructed by dunes and scrub, while Titusville and Port Canaveral are further but free/low cost. There are a number of additional options further away; check out the information on our [Watching a Launch FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/faq/watching) (courtesy Julia Bergeron and the SLCA) for more.


### I'd like the closest possible view of this launch's booster landing. What's my best option?

Unfortunately, since the landing will be far downrange, you'll be lucky to even catch a glimpse of the entry burn (which is possible, though far from guaranteed, anywhere you have a clear shot to the eastern horizon). Other than that, this isn't possible, sorry, so you should optimize for launch accordingly.
